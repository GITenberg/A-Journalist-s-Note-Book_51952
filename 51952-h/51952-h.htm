    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">S</span>OME years ago
      there was an auction of wine at a country-house in Scotland, the late
      owner of which had taken pains to gain a reputation for judgment in the
      matter of wine-selecting. He had all his life been nearly as intemperate
      as a temperance orator in his denunciation of whisky as a drink, hoping to
      inculcate a taste for vintage clarets upon the Scots; but he that tells
      the tale&mdash;it is not a new one&mdash;says that the man died without
      seriously jeopardizing the popularity of the native manufacture. The wines
      that he had laid down brought good prices, however; but, at the close of
      the sale, several odd lots were &ldquo;put up,&rdquo; and all were bought by a local
      publican. A gentleman who had been present called upon the publican a few
      days afterwards, and found him engaged in mixing into one huge cask all
      the &ldquo;lots&rdquo; that he had bought&mdash;Larose, Johannisberg, Château Coutet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hallo,&rdquo; said the visitor, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s this mixture going to be, Rabbie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Weel, sir,&rdquo; said the publican, looking with one eye into the cask and
      mechanically giving the contents a stir with a bottle of Sauterne which he
      had just uncorked&mdash;&ldquo;Weel, sir, I think it should be port, but I&rsquo;m no
      sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These odd lots of journalistic experiences and recollections may be
      considered a book, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m no sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      After all, &ldquo;a book&rsquo;s a book although&rdquo;&mdash;it&rsquo;s written by a journalist.
      Nearly every writer of books nowadays becomes a journalist when he has
      written a sufficient number. He is usually encouraged in this direction by
      his publishers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a literary man, are you not?&rdquo; a stranger said to a friend of mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the contrary, I&rsquo;m a journalist,&rdquo; was the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I beg your pardon, I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; said the inquirer, detecting a certain
      indignant note in the disclaimer. &ldquo;I beg your pardon. What a fool I was to
      ask you such a question!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope he wasn&rsquo;t hurt,&rdquo; he added in an anxious voice when we were alone.
      &ldquo;It was a foolish question; I might have known that he was a journalist,
      <i>he looked so respectable</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We are all respectable nowadays. We belong to a recognised profession. We
      may pronounce our opinions on all questions of art, taste, religion,
      morals, and even finance, with some degree of diffidence: we are at
      present merely practising our scales, so to speak, upon our various
      &ldquo;organs,&rdquo; but there is every reason to believe that confidence will come
      in due time. Are not our ranks being recruited from Oxford? Some years ago
      men drifted into journalism; now it is looked on as a vocation. Journalism
      is taken seriously. In a word, we are respectable. Have we not been
      entertained by the Lord Mayor of London? Have we not entertained Monsieur
      Emile Zola?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      People have ceased to abuse us as they once did with great freedom: they
      merely abuse the journals which support us. This is a healthy sign; for it
      may be taken for granted that people will invariably abuse the paper for
      which they subscribe. They do not seem to feel that they get the worth of
      their subscription unless they do so. It is the same principle that causes
      people to sneer at a dinner at which they have been entertained. If we are
      not permitted to abuse our host, whom may we abuse? The one thing that a
      man abuses more than to-day&rsquo;s paper is the negligence of the boy who omits
      to deliver it some morning. Only in one town where I lived did I find that
      a newspaper was popular. (It was not the one for which I wrote.) The
      fathers and mothers taught their children to pray, &ldquo;God bless papa, mamma,
      and the editor of the <i>Clackmannan Standard</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I met that editor some years afterwards. He celebrated a sort of impromptu
      Comminution Service against the people amongst whom he had lived. They had
      never paid for their subscriptions or their advertisements, and they had
      thus lowered the <i>Standard</i> of Clackmannan and of the editor&rsquo;s
      confidence in his fellow-men.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The only newspaper that is in a hopeless condition is the one which is
      neither blessed at all nor cursed at all. Such a newspaper appeals to no
      section of the public. It has always seemed to me a matter of question
      whether a man is better satisfied with a paper that reflects (so far as it
      is possible for a paper to do so) his own views, or with one that reflects
      the views that he most abhors. I am inclined to believe that a man is in a
      better humour with those of his fellow-men whom he has thoroughly abused,
      than with the one whom he greets every morning on the top of his omnibus.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is quite a simple matter to abuse a newspaper into popularity. One of
      the Georges whose biographies have been so pleasantly and touchingly
      written by Thackeray and Mr. Justin M&rsquo;Carthy, conferred a lasting
      popularity upon the man whom he told to get out of his way or he would
      kick him out of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moral of this is, that to be insulted by a monarch confers a greater
      distinction upon a man living in Clapham or even Brixton than to be
      treated courteously by a greengrocer.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      But though people continue to abuse the paper for which they subscribe,
      and for which they are usually some year or two in arrears in the matter
      of payment, still it appears to me that the public are slowly beginning to
      comprehend that newspapers are written (mostly) by journalists. Until
      recently there was, I think, a notion that journalists sat round a
      bar-parlour telling stories and drinking whisky and water while the
      newspapers were being produced. The fact is, that most of the surviving
      anecdotes of the journalists of a past generation smell of the
      bar-parlour. The practical jesters of the fifties and the punsters of the
      roaring forties were tap-room journalists. They died hard. The journalists
      of to-day do not even smile at those brilliant sallies&mdash;bequeathed by
      a past generation&mdash;about wearing frock-coats and evening dress, about
      writing notices of plays without stirring from the taproom, about the
      mixing up of criticisms of books with police-court reports. Such were the
      humours of journalism thirty or forty years ago. We have formed different
      ideas as to the elements of humour in these days. Whatever we may leave
      undone it is not our legitimate work.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      It was when journalism was in a state of transition that a youth, waiting
      on a railway platform, was addressed by a stranger (one of those men who
      endeavour to make religious zeal a cloak for impertinence)&mdash;&ldquo;My dear
      young friend, are you a Christian?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the youth, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a reporter on the <i>Camberwell Chronicle</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand, it was a very modern journalist whose room was invaded
      by a number of pretty little girls one day, just to keep him company and
      chat with him for an hour or so, as it was the day his paper&mdash;a
      weekly one&mdash;went to press. In order to get rid of them, he presented
      each of them with a copy of a little book which he had just published,
      writing on the flyleaf, &ldquo;With the author&rsquo;s compliments.&rdquo; Just as the girls
      were going away, one of them spied a neatly bound Oxford Bible that was
      lying on the desk for editorial notice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should so much like that,&rdquo; she cried, pouncing upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you shall have it, my dear, if you clear off immediately,&rdquo; said the
      editor; and, turning up the flyleaf, he wrote hastily on it, &ldquo;<i>With the
      author&rsquo;s compliments</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yes, he was a modern journalist, and took a reasonable view of the
      authoritative nature of his calling.
    </p>
    <p>

    <p>
      Our position is, I affirm, becoming recognised by the world; but now and
      again I am made to feel that such recognition does not invariably extend
      to all the members of our profession. Some years ago I was getting my hair
      cut in Regent Street, and, as usual, the practitioner remarked in a
      friendly way that I was getting very grey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been getting a grey hair or so for some time. I don&rsquo;t
      know how it is. I&rsquo;m not much over thirty.&rdquo; (I repeat that the incident
      occurred some years ago.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir, you&rsquo;re not what might be called old,&rdquo; said he indulgently.
      &ldquo;Maybe you&rsquo;re doing some brain-work?&rdquo; he suggested, after a pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brain-work?&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Oh no! I work for a daily paper, and usually write
      a column of leading articles every night. I produce a book a year, and a
      play every now and again. But brain-work&mdash;oh no!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, in that case, sir, it must be due to something else. Maybe you drink
      a bit, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I did not buy the bottle which he offered me at four-and-nine. I left the
      shop dissatisfied.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is why I hesitate to affirm that modern journalism is wholly
      understanded of the people.
    </p>
    <p>
      But for that matter it is not wholly understanded of the people who might
      be expected to know something about it. The proprietor of a newspaper on
      which I worked some years ago made use of me one day to translate a few
      lines of Greek which appeared on the back of an old print in his
      possession. My powers amazed him. The lines were from an obscure and
      little-known poem called the &ldquo;Odyssey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must read a great deal, my boy,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      I shook my head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fact is,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve lately had so much reviewing to do that I
      haven&rsquo;t been able to read a single book.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s too hard on you,&rdquo; said he gravely. &ldquo;Get some of the others of the
      staff to help you. You mustn&rsquo;t neglect your reading for the sake of
      reviewing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I didn&rsquo;t.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon another occasion the son of this gentleman left a message for me that
      he had taken a three-volume novel, the name of which he had forgotten,
      from a parcel of books that had arrived the previous day, but that he
      would like a review of it to appear the next morning, as his wife said it
      was a capital story.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was quite annoyed when the review did not appear.
    </p>

    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      But there are, I have reason to know, many people who have got no more
      modern ideas respecting that branch of journalism known as reviewing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you reading that book for pleasure or to criticise it?&rdquo; I was asked
      not so long ago by a young woman who ought to have known better. &ldquo;Oh, I
      forgot,&rdquo; she added, before I could think of anything sharp to say by way
      of reply&mdash;&ldquo;I forgot: if you meant to review it you wouldn&rsquo;t read it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I thought of the sharp reply two days later.
    </p>
    <p>
      So it is, I say, that some of the people who read what we write from day
      to day, have still got only the vaguest notions of how our work is turned
      out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Long ago I used to wish that the reviewers would only read the books I
      wrote before criticising them; but now my dearest wish is that they will
      review them (favourably) without reading them.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      I heard some time ago of a Scot who, full of that brave sturdy spirit of
      self-reliance which is the precious endowment of the race of North
      Britons, came up to London to fight his way in the ranks of literature.
      The grand inflexible independence of the man asserted itself with such
      obstinacy that he was granted a Civil List Pension; and while in receipt
      of this form of out-door relief for poets who cannot sell their poetry, he
      began a series of attacks upon literature as a trade, and gave to the
      world an autobiography in a sentence, by declaring that literature and
      deterioration go hand in hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was surely a very nasty thing for the sturdy Scotchman, who had
      attained to the honourable independence of the national almshouse, to say,
      just as people were beginning to look on literature as a profession.
    </p>
    <p>
      But then he sat down and forthwith reeled off a string of doggerel verses,
      headed &ldquo;The Dismal Throng.&rdquo; In this fourth-form satirical jingle he abused
      some of the ablest of modern literary men for taking a pessimistic view of
      life. Now, who on earth can blame literary men for feeling a trifle dismal
      if what the independent pensioner says is true, and success in literature
      can only be obtained in exchange for a soul? The man who takes the most
      pessimistic view of the profession of literature should be the last to
      sneer at a literary man looking sadly on life.

      the specimens&mdash;A masterpiece&mdash;-&ldquo;Stilt your friend&rdquo;&mdash;A
      jaunty emigrant&mdash;A thirsty knave&mdash;His one rival&mdash;Three

    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span> HAVE come in
      contact with many journalists of the old school&mdash;the frock-coat and
      muffler type. The first of the class whom I met was for a few months a
      reporter on a newspaper in Ireland with which I was connected. He had at
      one time been a soldier, and had deserted. I tried, though I was only a
      boy, to get some information from him that I might use afterwards, for I
      recognised his value as the representative of a race that was, I felt,
      certain to become extinct. I talked to him as I talked&mdash;with the aid
      of an interpreter&mdash;to a Botjesman in the South African veldt: I
      wanted to learn something about the habits of a doomed type. I succeeded
      in some measure.
    </p>
    <p>
      The result of my researches into the nature of both savages was to
      convince me that they were born liars. The reporter carried a pair of
      stage whiskers and a beard with him when sent to do any work in a country
      district; the fact being that the members of the Royal Irish Constabulary
      in the country barracks are the most earnest students of the paper known
      as <i>Hue and Cry</i>, and the man said that, as his description appeared
      in every number of that organ, he should most certainly be identified by a
      smart country policeman if he did not wear a disguise. Years afterwards I
      got a letter from him from one of her Majesty&rsquo;s gaols. He wanted the loan
      of some money and the gift of a hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      This man wrote shorthand admirably, and an excellent newspaper English.

      Another specimen of the race had actually attained to the dizzy eminence
      of editor of a fourth-class newspaper in a town of one hundred thousand
      inhabitants. In those days Mr. Craven Robertson was the provincial
      representative of Captain Hawtree in <i>Caste</i>, and upon the Captain
      Hawtree of Craven Robertson this &ldquo;journalist&rdquo; founded his style. He wore
      an eyeglass, a moustache with waxed ends, and a frock coat very carefully
      brushed. His hair was thin on the top&mdash;but he made the most of it. He
      was the sort of man whom one occasionally meets on the Promenade at Nice,
      wearing a number of orders on the breast of his coat&mdash;the order of Il
      Bacio di St. Judæus, the scarlet riband of Ste. Rahab di Jericho, the
      Brazen Lyre of SS. Ananias and Sapphira. He was the sort of man whom one
      styles &ldquo;Chevalier&rdquo; by instinct. He was the most plausible knave in the
      world, though how people allowed him to cheat them was a mystery to me.
      His masterpiece of impudence I have always considered to be a letter which
      he wrote to a brother-editor, from whom he had borrowed a sum of money, to
      be repaid on the first of the next month. When the appointed day came he
      chanced to meet this editor-creditor in the street, and asking him, with a
      smile as if he had been on the lookout for him, to step into the nearest
      shop, he called for a sheet of paper and a pen, and immediately wrote an
      order to the cashier of his paper to pay Mr. G. the sum of five pounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There you are, my dear sir,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Just send a clerk round to our
      office and hand that to the cashier. Meantime accept my hearty thanks for
      the accommodation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. G. lost no time in presenting the order; but, as might have been
      expected, it was dishonoured by the cashier, who declared that the editor
      was already eight months in advance in drawing his salary. Mr. G. hastened
      back to his own office and forthwith wrote a letter of furious
      upbraidings, in which I have good reason to suspect he expressed his views
      of the conduct of his debtor, and threatened to &ldquo;take proceedings,&rdquo; as the
      grammar of the law has it, for the recovery of his money.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day Mr. G. received back his own letter unopened, but inside the
      cover that enclosed it to him was the following:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Mr. G.,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may perhaps be surprised to receive your letter with the seal
      unbroken, but when you come to reflect calmly over the unfortunate
      incident of your sending it to me, I am sure that you will no longer be
      surprised. I am persuaded that you wrote it to me on the impulse of the
      moment, otherwise it would not contain the strong language which, I think
      I may assume, constitutes the major portion of its contents. Knowing your
      natural kindness of disposition, and feeling assured that in after years
      the consciousness of having written such a letter to me would cause you
      many a pang in your secret moments, I am anxious that you should be spared
      much self-reproach, and consequently return your letter unopened. You
      will, I am certain, perceive that in adopting this course I am acting for
      the best. Do not follow the next impulse of your heart and ask my
      forgiveness. I have really nothing to forgive, not having read your
      letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With kindest regards, I remain
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still your friend
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A. Swinne Dell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If this transaction does not represent the high-water mark of knavery&mdash;if
      it does not show something akin to genius in an art that has many
      exponents, I scarcely know where one should look for evidence in this
      direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Five years after the disappearance of Mr. A. Swinne Dell from the scene of
      this <i>coup</i> of his, I caught a glimpse of him among the steerage
      passengers aboard a steamer that called at Madeira when I was spending a
      holiday at that lovely island. His frock-coat was giving signs (about the
      collar) of wear, and also (under the arms) of tear. I could not see his
      boots, but I felt sure that they were down at the heel. Still, he held his
      head jauntily as he pointed out to a fellow-passenger the natural charms
      of the landscape above Funchal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another of the old school who pursued a career of knavery by the light of
      the sacred lamp of journalism was, I regret to say, an Irishman. His
      powers of absorbing drink were practically unlimited. I never knew but one
      rival to him in this way, and that was when I was in South Africa. We had
      left our waggon, and were crouching in most uncomfortable postures behind
      a mighty cactus on the bank of a river, waiting for the chance of potting
      a gemsbok that might come to drink. Instead of the graceful gemsbok there
      came down to the water a huge hippopotamus. He had clearly been having a
      good time among the native mealies, and had come for some liquid
      refreshment before returning to his feast. He did not plunge into the
      water, but simply put his head down to it and began to drink. After five
      minutes or so we noticed an appreciable fall in the river. After a quarter
      of an hour great rocks in the river-bed began to be disclosed. At the end
      of twenty minutes the broad stream had dwindled away to a mere trickle of
      water among the stones. At the end of half an hour we began to think that
      he had had as much as was good for him&mdash;we wanted a kettleful of
      water for our tea&mdash;so I put an elephant cartridge (&lsquo;577) into my
      rifle and aimed at the brute&rsquo;s eye. He lifted up his head out of pure
      curiosity, and perceiving that men with rifles were handy, slouched off,
      grumbling like a professional agitator on being turned out of a public
      house.
    </p>
    <p>
      That hippopotamus was the only rival I ever knew to the old-school
      journalist whose ways I can recall&mdash;only he was never known to taste
      water. Like the man in one of H. J. Byron&rsquo;s plays, he could absorb any
      &ldquo;given&rdquo;&mdash;I use the word advisedly&mdash;any given quantity of liquor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you ever sober, my man?&rdquo; I asked of him one day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sober three times a day,&rdquo; he replied huskily. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sober now. This is
      one of the times,&rdquo; he added mournfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were blind drunk this morning&mdash;I can swear to that,&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; he replied promptly. &ldquo;But what&rsquo;se good of raking up the past,
      sir? Let the dead past burits dead.&rdquo; He took a step or two toward the
      door, and then returned. He carefully brushed a speck of dust off the rim
      of his hat. All such men wear the tallest of silk hats, and seem to feel
      that they would be scandalised by the appearance of a speck of dust on the
      nap. &ldquo;D&rsquo;ye know that I can take three crops out of myself in the day?&rdquo; he
      inquired blandly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three crops?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three crops&mdash;I said so, of drunk. I rise in morn&rsquo;n,&mdash;drunk
      before twelve; sleep it off by two, and drunk again by five; sleep it off
      by eight&mdash;do my work and go to bed drunk at two a.m. You haven&rsquo;t such
      a thing as half-a-crown about you, sir? I left my purse on the grand piano
      before I came out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was under the impression that this particular man was dead years ago;
      and I was thus greatly surprised when, on jumping on a tramcar in a
      manufacturing town in Yorkshire quite recently, I recognised my old friend
      in a man who had just awakened in a corner, and was endeavouring to
      attract the attention of the conductor. When, after much incipient
      whistling and waving of his arms, he succeeded in drawing the conductor to
      his side, he inquired if the car was anywhere near the Wilfrid Lawson
      Temperance Hotel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll let you down when we come to it,&rdquo; said the conductor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do,&rdquo; said the other in his old husky tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lemme down at the Wellfed Laws Tenpence Otell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In another minute he was fast asleep as before.

      At present no penal consequences follow any one who calls himself a
      literary man. It is taken for granted, I suppose, that the crime brings
      its own punishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the most depressing books that any one straying through the King&rsquo;s
      Highway of literature could read is Mr. George Gissing&rsquo;s &ldquo;The New Grub
      Street.&rdquo; What makes it all the more depressing is the fact of its carrying
      conviction with it to all readers. Every one must feel that the squalor
      described in this book has a real existence. The only consolation that any
      one engaged in a branch of literature can have on reading &ldquo;The New Grub
      Street,&rdquo; comes from the reflection that not one of the poor wretches
      described in its pages had the least aptitude for the business.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a town of moderate size in which I lived, there were forty men and
      women who described themselves for directory purposes as &ldquo;novelists.&rdquo; Not
      one of them had ever published a volume; but still they all believed
      themselves to be novelists. There are thousands of men who call themselves
      journalists even now, but who are utterly incapable of writing a decent
      &ldquo;par.&rdquo; I have known many such men. The most incompetent invariably become
      dissatisfied with life in the provinces, and hurry off to London, having
      previously borrowed their train fare. I constantly stumble upon provincial
      failures in London. Sometimes on the Embankment I literally stumble upon
      them, for I have found them lying in shady nooks there trying to forget
      the world&rsquo;s neglect in sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why on earth such men take to journalism has always been a mystery to me.
      If they had the least aptitude for it they would be earning money by
      journalism instead of trying to borrow half-crowns as journalists.

      I knew of one who, several years ago, migrated to London. For a long time
      I heard nothing about him; but one night a friend of mine mentioned his
      name, and asked me if I had ever known him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fact is,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I had rather a curious experience of him a few
      months ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were by no means an exception to the general run of people who have
      ever come in contact with him,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;What was your experience?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; replied he, &ldquo;I came across him casually one night, and as he
      seemed inclined to walk in my direction, I asked him if he would mind
      coming on to my lodgings to have a bottle of beer. He found that his
      engagements for the night permitted of his doing so, and we strolled on
      together. I found that there was supper enough for two adults in the
      locker, and our friend found that his engagements permitted of his taking
      a share in the humble repast. He took fully his share of the beer, and
      then I offered him a pipe, and stirred up the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We talked until two o&rsquo;clock in the morning, and, as he told me he lived
      about five miles away&mdash;he didn&rsquo;t seem quite sure whether it was at
      Hornsey or Clapham&mdash;I said he could not do better than occupy a spare
      truckle that was in my bedroom. He said he thought that I was right, and
      we retired. We breakfasted together in the morning, and then we walked
      into Fleet Street, where we parted. That night he overtook me on my way to
      my lodgings, and in the friendliest manner possible accompanied me
      thither. Here the programme of the night before was repeated. The third
      night I quite expected to be overtaken by him; but I was mistaken. I was
      not overtaken by him: he was sitting in my lodgings waiting for me. He
      gave me a most cordial welcome&mdash;I will say that for him. The night
      following I had a sort of instinct that I should find him waiting for me
      again in my sitting-room. Once more I was mistaken. He was not waiting for
      me; he had already eaten his supper&mdash;<i>my supper</i>, and had gone
      to bed&mdash;<i>my bed</i>; but with his usual thoughtfulness, he had left
      a short note for me upbraiding me, but in a genial and quite a gentlemanly
      way, for staying out so late, and begging me not to awake him, as he was
      very tired, and&mdash;also genially&mdash;inquiring if it was absolutely
      necessary for me to make such a row in my bath in the mornings. He was a
      light sleeper, he said, and a little noise disturbed him. I did not awake
      him; but the next morning I was distinctly cool towards him. I remarked
      that I thought it unlikely that I should be at home that night. He begged
      of me not to allow him to interfere with my plans. When I returned that
      night, I found him sitting at my table playing cards with a bleareyed
      foreigner, whom he courteously introduced as his friend Herr Vanderbosch
      or something.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Draw your chair to the table, old chap, and join in with us. I&rsquo;ll see
      that you get something to drink in a minute,&rsquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thanked him, but remarked that I had a conscientious objection to all
      games of cards.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Soh?&rsquo; said the foreigner. &lsquo;Das is yust var yo makes ze mistook. Ze game
      of ze gards it is grand&mdash;soblime!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He added a few well-chosen sentences about sturm und drang or something;
      and in about five minutes I found myself getting a complete slanging for
      my narrow-minded prejudices, and for my attempt to curtail the innocent
      recreation of others. I will say this for our friend, however: he never
      for a moment allowed our little difference on what was after all a purely
      academic question, to interfere with his display of hospitality to myself
      and Herr Vanderbosch. He filled our tumblers, and was lavish with the
      tobacco jar. When I rose to go to bed he called me aside, and said he had
      made arrangements for me to sleep in the truckle for the night, in order
      to admit of his occupying my bed with Herr Vanderbosch&mdash;the poor
      devil, he explained to me with many deprecating nods, had not, he feared,
      any place to sleep that night. But at this point I turned. I assured him
      that I was constitutionally unfitted for sleeping in a truckle, or, in
      fact, in any bed but my own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;All right,&rsquo; he cried in a huff, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll sleep in the truckle, and I&rsquo;ll
      make up a good fire for him to sleep before on the sofa.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we all breakfasted together, and the next night the two gentlemen
      appeared once more at the door of the house. They were walking in as
      usual, when the landlady asked them where they were going.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Why, upstairs, to be sure,&rsquo; said our friend. &ldquo;&lsquo;Oh no!&rsquo; said the
      landlady, &lsquo;you&rsquo;re not doing that. Mr. Plantagenet has left his rooms and
      gone to the country for a month&mdash;maybe two&mdash;and the rooms is let
      to another gent.&rsquo; &ldquo;Well, our friend swore that he had been treated
      infernally, and Herr Vanderbosch alluded to me as a schweinhund&mdash;I
      heard him. I fancy the word must be a term of considerable opprobrium in
      the German tongue. Anyhow, they didn&rsquo;t get past the landlady,&mdash;she
      takes a large size in doors,&mdash;and after a while our friend&rsquo;s menaces
      dwindled down to a request to be permitted to remove his luggage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll bring it down to you,&rsquo; said the landlady; and she shut the hall
      door very gently, leaving them on the step outside. When she brought down
      the luggage&mdash;it consisted of three paper collars and one cuff with a
      fine carbuncle stud in it&mdash;they were gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our friend told some one the other day of the disgraceful way I had
      treated him and his foreign associate. But he says he would not have
      minded so much if the landlady had not shut the door so gently.&rdquo;

      Another remarkable pressman with whom I came in contact several years ago
      was a member of the reporting staff of an Irish newspaper. One day I
      noticed him wearing what appeared to me to be an extremely fine ring. It
      was set with an antique polished intaglio surrounded by diamonds. The ring
      was probably unique, and would be worth perhaps £70 to a collector. I have
      seen very inferior mediaeval intaglios sold for that sum. I examined the
      diamonds with a lens, and then inquired of the youth where he had bought
      it, and if he was anything of a collector.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I picked it up going home one wet night,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I advertised for
      the owner in all the papers for a week&mdash;it cost me thirty shillings
      in that way,&mdash;but no one ever came forward to claim it. I would
      gladly have sold the thing for thirty shillings at the end of a month; but
      then I found that it was worth close upon a hundred pounds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re the luckiest chap I ever met,&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the course of a short time another of the reporters asked me if I had
      ever seen the watch that the same youth habitually wore. I replied that I
      had never seen it, but should like to do so. The same night I was in the
      reporters&rsquo; room, when the one who had mentioned the watch to me asked the
      wearer of the article if ten o&rsquo;clock had yet struck. The youth forthwith
      drew out of his pocket one of the most charming little watches I ever saw.
      The back was Italian enamel on gold, both outside and within, and the
      outer case was bordered with forty-five rubies. A black pearl about the
      size of a pea was at the bow, right round the edge of the case were
      diamonds, and in the rim for the glass were twenty-five rubies and four
      stones which I fancied at a casual glance were pale sapphires. I examined
      these stones with my magnifier, and I thought I should have fainted when I
      found that they were blue diamonds.

     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      was the inscription which I managed to make out on the dial.
    </p>
    <p>
      I handed back the watch to the reporter&mdash;his salary was £120 per
      annum&mdash;and inquired if he had found this article also.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, with a laugh. &ldquo;I picked that up, curiously enough, during
      a trip that I once made to the Scilly Islands. I advertised it in the
      Plymouth papers the next day, for I believed it to have been dropped by
      some wealthy tourist; but I got no applicant for it; and then I came to
      the conclusion that the watch had been among the treasures of some of the
      descendants of the smugglers and wreckers of the old days. It keeps good
      enough time now, though a watchmaker valued the works at five shillings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any time you want a hundred pounds&mdash;a hundred and fifty pounds,&rdquo;
       said I, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t hesitate to bring that watch to me. Have you found many
      other articles in the course of your life?&rdquo; I asked, as I was leaving the
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lots,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;When I was in Liverpool I lived about two miles from
      my office, and through getting into a habit of keeping my eyes on the
      ground, I used to come across something almost every week. Unfortunately,
      most of my finds were claimed by the owners.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have no reason to complain,&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was set thinking if there might not be the potentialities of wealth in
      the art of walking with one&rsquo;s eyes modestly directed to the ground; and
      for three nights I was actually idiot enough to walk home from my office
      with looks, not &ldquo;commercing with the skies,&rdquo; but&mdash;it was purely a
      question of commerce&mdash;with the pavements. The first night I nearly
      transfixed a policeman with my umbrella, for the rain was coming down in
      torrents; the second, I got my hat knocked into the mud by coming in
      contact with the branch of a tree overhanging the railings of a square,
      and the third I received the impact of a large-boned tipsy man, who was,
      as the idiom of the country has it, trying to walk on both sides of the
      road at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      I held up my head in future.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reporter left the newspaper in the course of a few months, and I never
      saw him again. But quite recently I was reading Miss Dougall&rsquo;s novel
      &ldquo;Beggars All,&rdquo; and when I came upon the account of the reporter who
      carries out several adroit schemes of burglary, the recollection of the
      remarkable &ldquo;finds&rdquo; of the young man whose ring and watch had excited my
      envy, flashed across my mind; and I began to wonder if it was possible
      that he had pursued a similar course to that which Miss Dougall&rsquo;s hero
      found so profitable. I should like to consult Mr. Sherlock Holmes on this
      point when he returns from Switzerland&mdash;we expect him every day.
    </p>
    <p>
      At any rate, it is certain that the calling of a reporter would afford
      many opportunities to a clever burglar, or even an adroit pickpocket. A
      reporter can take his walks abroad at any hour of the night without
      exciting the suspicion of a policeman; or, should such suspicion be
      aroused, he has only to say &ldquo;Press,&rdquo; and he may go anywhere he pleases.
      The Press rush in where the public dare not tread; and no one need be
      surprised if some day a professional burglar takes to stenography as an
      auxiliary to the realisation of his illegitimate aims.

      One of the countless St. Peter stories has this privilege of the Press for
      its subject, and a reporter for its hero. This gentleman was walking
      jauntily through the gate of him &ldquo;who keeps the keys,&rdquo; but was stopped by
      the stern janitor, who inquired if he had a ticket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Press,&rdquo; said the reporter, trying to pass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean by that? You know you can&rsquo;t be admitted anywhere without
      a ticket.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you that I belong to the Press; you don&rsquo;t expect a reporter to
      pay, do you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not? Why shouldn&rsquo;t you be treated the same as the rest of the people?
      I can&rsquo;t make flesh of one and fish of another,&rdquo; added St. Peter, as if a
      professional reminiscence had occurred to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reporter suddenly brightened up. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want exceptional treatment,&rdquo;
       said he. &ldquo;Now that I come to think of it, aren&rsquo;t they all <i>deadheads</i>
      who come here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I fancy that reporter was admitted.

    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>T is only within
      the past few years that the Editor has obtained public recognition as a
      personality; previously his personality was merged in the proprietor, and
      when his efforts were successful in keeping a Corporation from making
      fools of themselves&mdash;this is assuming an extreme case of success&mdash;or
      in exposing some attempted fraud that would have ruined thousands of
      people, he was compelled to accept his reward through the person of the
      proprietor. The proprietor was made a J.P., and sometimes even became
      Mayor or Chairman of the Board of Guardians, when the editor succeeded in
      making the paper a power in the county. Latterly, however, the editors of
      some provincial journals have been obtaining recognition.
    </p>
    <p>
      They have been granted the dubious honour of knighthood; and the public
      have discovered that the brains which have dictated a policy that has
      influenced the destinies of a Ministry, may be entrusted with the
      consideration of sewage and main drainage questions on a Town Council, or
      with the question of the relative degrees of culpability of a man who
      jumps upon his wife&rsquo;s face and is fined ten shillings, and the boy who
      steals a raw turnip and is sent to a reformatory for five years&mdash;a
      period quite insufficient for the adequate digestion of that comestible,
      which it would appear boys are ready to sacrifice years of their liberty
      to obtain.
    </p>
    <p>
      I must say that, with one exception, the proprietors whom I have met were
      highly competent business men&mdash;men whose judgment and public spirit
      were deserving of that wide recognition which they nearly always obtained
      from their fellow-citizens. One, and one only, was not precisely of this
      type. He used to write with a blue pencil across an article some very
      funny comments.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have before me at this moment a letter in which he asked me to
      abbreviate something; and he gave me an example of how to do it by cutting
      out a letter of the word&mdash;he spelt it <i>abrievate</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had a perfect passion for what he called &ldquo;exclusives.&rdquo; The most trivial
      incident&mdash;the overturning of a costermonger&rsquo;s barrow, and the number
      of the contents sustaining fatal injuries; the blowing off of a
      clergyman&rsquo;s hat in the street, with a professional opinion as to the
      damage done; the breaking of a window in a private house&mdash;he regarded
      as good foundation for an &ldquo;exclusive&rdquo;; and indeed it must be said that the
      information given to the public by the organ of which he was proprietor
      was rarely ever to be found in a rival paper. At the same time, upon no
      occasion of his obtaining a really important piece of news did he succeed
      in keeping it from the others. This annoyed him extremely He was in great
      demand as chairman of amateur reciting classes&mdash;a distinction that
      was certainly dearly purchased. I never knew of one of these reciting
      entertainments being refused a full report in his newspaper upon any
      occasion when he presided. He also aspired to the chairmanship of small
      political meetings, and once when he found himself in such a position, he
      said he would sing the audience a song, and he carried out his threat. His
      song was probably more convincing than his speech would have been. He had
      a famous story for platform use. It concerned a donkey that he knew when
      they were both young.
    </p>
    <p>
      He said it made people laugh, and it surely did. At a public dinner he
      formulated the plausible theory that to be a good player of golf was to be
      a gentleman. He was a poor golfer himself.

    <p>
      Now, regarding London editors I have not much to say. I am not personally
      acquainted with any one of them. But for twelve years I read every
      political article that appeared in each of the six principal London daily
      papers; I also read a report of every speech made in the House of Commons,
      and of every speech made by a statesman of Cabinet rank outside
      Parliament; and I am prepared to say that the great majority of these
      speeches bore the most unmistakable evidence of being&mdash;well, not
      exactly inspired by, but certainly influenced by some leading article. In
      one word, my experience is that what the newspapers say in the morning the
      statesmen say in the evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course Mr. Gladstone must not be included in the statesmen to whom I
      refer. His inspiration comes from another direction. That is how he
      succeeds in startling so many people.
    </p>
    <p>
      The majority of provincial editors include, I have good reason to know,
      some of the best men in the profession. Only here and there does one meet
      with a fossil of journalism who is content to write a column of platitudes
      over a churchwarden pipe and then to go home to sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      With only one such did I come in contact recently. He was connected with a
      newspaper which should have had unbounded influence in its district, but
      which had absolutely none. The &ldquo;editor&rdquo; was accustomed to enter his room
      about noon, and he left it between seven and eight in the evening, having
      turned out a column of matter of which he was an earnest reader the next
      morning. And yet this same newspaper received during the night sometimes
      twelve columns of telegraphic news and verbatim reports of the chief
      speeches in Parliament.
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor old gentleman had never been in London, and never could see why I
      should be so constantly going to that city. He was under the impression
      that George Eliot was a man, and he one day asked me what the Royal
      Academy was. Having learned that it was a place where pictures that richly
      deserved exposure were hung, he shortly afterwards assumed that the French
      Academy was a gallery in which naughty French pictures&mdash;he assumed
      that everything French was naughty&mdash;were exhibited. He occasionally
      referred to the <i>Temps</i> phonetically, and up to the day of his death
      he never knew why I laughed when I first heard his pronunciation of the
      name of that organ.
    </p>
    <p>
      The one dread of his life was that I might some time inadvertently suggest
      that I was the editor of the paper. As if any sane human being would have
      such an aspiration! His opportunity came at last. A cabinet photograph of
      a man and a dog arrived at the office one day addressed to the editor. He
      hastened to the proprietor and &ldquo;proved&rdquo; that the photograph represented me
      and my dog, and that it had been addressed &ldquo;to the editor.&rdquo; The proprietor
      was not clever enough to perceive that the features of the portrait in no
      way resembled those with which I am obliged to put up, and so I ran a
      chance of being branded as a pretender.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortunately, however, the fascinating little daughter of the proprietary
      household contrived to see the photograph, and on being questioned as to
      its likeness to a member of the staff, declared that there was no one half
      so goodlooking connected with the paper. On being assured that the
      original had already been identified, she expressed her willingness to
      stake five pounds upon her opinion; and the injured editor accepted her
      offer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, all this time I had never been applied to by the disputants, though I
      might have been expected to know something of the matter,&mdash;people
      generally remember a visit to their photographer or their stockbroker,&mdash;but
      just as the young lady was about to appeal to me as an unprejudiced
      arbiter on the question at issue, the manager of the advertisement
      department sent to inquire if any one on the editorial staff had come upon
      a photograph of a man and a collie. An advertisement for a lost collie
      had, he said, been appearing in the paper, and a postcard had just been
      received from the owner stating that he had forwarded a photograph of the
      animal, in order that, should any one bring a collie to the office and
      claim the reward, the advertising department would be in a position to see
      that the animal was the right one.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young lady got her five pounds, and, having a considerable interest in
      the stocking of a farm, purchased with it an active young boar which, in
      an impulse of flattery, she named after me, and which, so far as I have
      been able to gather, is doing very well, and has already seen his
      children&rsquo;s children.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I asked the young lady why she had called the animal after me, she
      said it was because he was a bore. She had a graceful wit.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a weak moment this editor confided to me that he was engaged in writing
      a book&mdash;&ldquo;A History of the Orange&rdquo; was to be the title, he told me;
      and he added that I could have no idea of the trouble it was causing him;
      but there he was wrong. After this he was in the habit of writing a note
      to me about once a week, asking me if I would oblige him by doing his work
      for him, as all his time was engrossed by his &ldquo;History.&rdquo; It appears to me
      rather melancholy that the lack of enterprise among publishers is so great
      that this work has not yet been given a chance of appearing. I looked
      forward to it to clear up many doubtful points of great interest. Up to
      the present, for instance, no intelligent effort has been made to
      determine if it was the introduction of the orange into Great Britain that
      brought about the Sunday-school treat, or if the orange was imported in
      order to meet the legitimate requirements of this entertainment.

      Human nature&mdash;-and there is a good deal of it in a large
      manufacturing centre&mdash;could not be restrained in the neighbourhood of
      such a relic of a past generation, and, consequently, that form of
      pleasantry known as the hoax was constantly attempted upon him. One
      morning the correspondence columns, which he was supposed to edit with
      scrupulous care, appeared headed with an account of the discovery of some
      ancient pottery bearing a Latin inscription&mdash;the most venerable and
      certainly the most transparent of newspaper hoaxes.
    </p>
    <p>
      It need scarcely be said that there was an extraordinary demand for copies
      of the issue of that day; but luckily the thing was discovered in time to
      disappoint a large number of those persons who came to the office to mock
      at the simplicity of the good old soul, who fancied he had found a
      congenial topic when he received the letter headed with an appeal to
      archæologists.
    </p>
    <p>
      Is there a more contemptible creature in the world than the newspaper
      hoaxer? The wretch who can see fun in obtaining the publication of some
      filthy phrase in a newspaper that is certain to be read by numbers of
      women, should, in my mind, be treated as the flinger of a dynamite bomb
      among a crowd of innocent people. The sender of a false notice of a
      marriage, a birth, or a death, is usually difficult to bring to justice,
      but when found, he&mdash;or she&mdash;should be treated as a social leper.
      The pain caused by such heartless hoaxes is incalculable.

      Sometimes a careless reporter, or foreman printer, is unwittingly the
      means of causing much annoyance, and even consternation, by allowing an
      obituary notice to appear prematurely. On every well-managed paper there
      is a set of pigeon-holed obituaries of eminent persons, local as well as
      national. When it is almost certain that one of them is at the point of
      death, the sketch is written up to the latest date, and frequently put in
      type, to be ready in case the news of the death should arrive when the
      paper is going to press. Now, I have known of several cases in which the
      &ldquo;set-up&rdquo; obituary notice contrived to appear before the person to whom it
      referred had breathed his last. This is undoubtedly a very painful
      occurrence, and in some cases it may actually precipitate the incident
      which it purports to record. Personally, I should not consider myself
      called on to die because a newspaper happened to publish an account of my
      death; but I know of at least one case in which a man actually succumbed
      out of compliment to a newspaper that had accidentally recorded his death.
    </p>
    <p>
      That person was not made of the same fibre as a certain eminent surgeon
      with whom I was well acquainted. He was thoughtful enough to send for a
      reporter on one Monday evening, and said that as he did not wish the pangs
      of death to be increased by the reflection that a ridiculous sketch of his
      career would be published in the newspapers, he thought he would just
      dictate three-quarters of a column of such a character as would allow of
      his dying without anything on his mind. Of course the reporter was
      delighted, and commenced as usual:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is with the deepest regret that we have to announce this morning the
      decease of one of our most eminent physicians, and best-known citizens.
      Dr. Theobald Smith, M.Sc., F.R.C.S.E., passed peacefully away at o&rsquo;clock
      {last night/this morning} at his residence, Pharmakon House, surrounded by
      the members of the family to whom he was so deeply attached, and to whom,
      though a father, he was still a friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, sir,&rdquo; said the reporter, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve left a space for the hour, and I can
      strike out either &lsquo;last night,&rsquo; or &lsquo;this morning,&rsquo; when I hear of your
      death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; said the doctor. &ldquo;Now, I&rsquo;ll give you some particulars of
      my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; said the reporter. &ldquo;You will not exceed three-quarters of a
      column, for we&rsquo;re greatly crushed for space just now. If you could put it
      off till Sunday, I could give you a column with leads, as Parliament
      doesn&rsquo;t sit on Saturday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It seemed a tempting offer; but the doctor, after pondering for a few
      moments, as if trying to recollect his engagements, shook his head, and
      said he would be glad to oblige, but the matter had really passed beyond
      his control.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But there&rsquo;ll surely be time for you to see a proof?&rdquo; cried the reporter,
      with some degree of anxiety in his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take good care of that,&rdquo; said the doctor. &ldquo;You can send it to me in
      the morning. I think I&rsquo;ll die between eleven and twelve at night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That would suit us exactly,&rdquo; said the reporter genially. &ldquo;We could then
      send the obituary away in the first page at one o&rsquo;clock. The foreman
      grumbles if he has to put obituaries on page 5, which goes down to the
      machine at half-past three.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor said that of course business was business, and he should do his
      best to accommodate the foreman.
    </p>
    <p>
      He died that night at twenty minutes past eleven.

      I have suggested the possibility of the record of a death in a public
      print having a disastrous effect upon a sick man, and the certainty of its
      causing pain to his relatives. This view was not taken by the eccentric
      proprietor to whom I have already alluded. Upon one occasion he heard
      casually that a man named Robinson had just died. He hastened to his
      office, found a reporter, and told him to write a paragraph regretting the
      death of Mr. Richard Robinson. He assumed that it was Richard Robinson who
      was dead, but it so happened that it was Mr. Thomas Robinson, although Mr.
      Richard Robinson had been in feeble health for some time. Now, when the
      son of the living Mr. Robinson called upon the proprietor the next day to
      state that his father had read the paragraph recording his death, and that
      the shock had completely prostrated him, the proprietor turned round upon
      him, and said that Mr. Robinson and his family should rather feel
      extremely grateful for the appearance of a paragraph of so complimentary a
      character. Young Mr. Robinson, fearing that the next move on the part of
      the proprietor would be to demand payment for the paragraph at scale
      rates, begged that his intrusion might be pardoned; and hurried away
      congratulating himself at having escaped very easily.

      Editors are always supposed to know nearly everything, and they nearly
      always do. In this respect they differ materially from the representatives
      of other professions. If you were to ask the average clergyman&mdash;if
      there is such a thing as an average clergyman&mdash;what he thought of the
      dramatic construction of a French vaudeville, he would probably feel hurt;
      but if an editor failed to give an intelligent opinion on this subject, as
      well as upon the tendencies to Socinianism displayed in the sermon of an
      eminent Churchman, he would be regarded as unfit for his business. You can
      get an intelligent opinion from an editor on almost any subject; but you
      are lucky if you can get an intelligent opinion on any one subject from
      the average professional man&mdash;a lawyer, of course, excepted.
    </p>
    <p>
      But undoubtedly curious specimens of editors might occasionally have been
      found in the smaller newspaper offices in the provinces long ago. More
      than twenty years have passed since the sub-editor of a rather important
      paper in a town in the Midlands interviewed, on a matter of professional
      etiquette, the editor&mdash;he was an Irishman&mdash;of a struggling organ
      in the same town.
    </p>
    <p>
      It appeared that the chief reporter of the sub-editor&rsquo;s paper had given
      some paragraph of news to a brother on the second paper, and yet when the
      latter was respectfully asked for an equivalent, he refused it; hence the
      need for diplomatic representations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say that our reporters must have a <i>quid pro quo</i> in every case
      where they have given a par. to yours,&rdquo; said the sub-editor, who was
      entrusted with the negotiations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Must have a what?&rdquo; asked the Irish editor. &ldquo;A <i>quid pro quo</i>,&rdquo; said
      the sub-editor. &ldquo;Now I&rsquo;ve come here for the <i>quid</i> and I don&rsquo;t mean
      to go until I get it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The editor looked at him, then felt for something in his waistcoat pocket.
      Producing a piece of that sort of tobacco known as Limerick twist, he bit
      it in two, and offered one portion to the sub-editor, saying, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
      your quid for you; but, so help me Gad, I&rsquo;ve only got what you see in my
      mouth to last me till morning.&rdquo;

       editor also may now and again be found to possess some eccentricities. He
      is the man who is taken on a newspaper in an emergency to fill the place
      of an editor who may perhaps be suffering from a serious illness, or who
      may, in an unguarded moment, have died. There is a class of journalists
      with whom being out of employment amounts almost to a profession in
      itself. But the &ldquo;unattached&rdquo; editor is usually no more brilliant a man
      than the unattached gentleman &ldquo;in holy orders&rdquo;&mdash;the clergyman who
      appears suddenly at the vestry door carrying a black bag, and probably
      with his nose a little red (the result of a cold railway journey), and who
      introduces himself to the sexton as ready to do duty for the legitimate,
      but temporarily incapacitated, incumbent, whose telegram he had received
      only the previous day.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the congregation are glad to get any one who can read the prayers with
      an air of authority in the absence of their pastor, so the proprietors of
      a newspaper are sometimes pleased to welcome the &ldquo;scratch,&rdquo; or casual,
      editor.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have met with a few of the class, but never with one whose chronic
      unattached condition I could not easily account for, before we had been
      together long. Most of them hated journalism&mdash;-and everything else
      (with one important exception). All of them boasted of their feats as
      journalists. A fine crusted specimen was accustomed to declare nightly
      that he had once kept hunters; another that he had not always been
      connected with such a miserable rag as the journal on which he was
      temporarily employed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been on the best papers in the three kingdoms,&rdquo; he shouted one
      night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s only another way of saying that you&rsquo;ve been kicked off the most
      influential organs in the country,&rdquo; remarked a bystander.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t look out you&rsquo;ll soon be kicked off another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No verbal retort is possible to such brutality of language. None was
      attempted.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I was explaining, the next day, to the proprietor how the chair in
      the editor&rsquo;s room came to be broken, and also how the silhouette of an
      octopus came to be executed so boldly in ink upon the wall of the same
      apartment, the &ldquo;scratch&rdquo; editor (his appellation had a double significance
      this day) entered suddenly. He said he had come to explain something.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now when a literary gentleman appears with long strips of sticking plaster
      loosely adhering to one side of his face, as white caterpillars adhere to
      a garden wall, and when, moreover, the perfume that floats on the air at
      his approach is that of a peppermint lozenge that has been preserved from
      decay in alcohol, any explanation that he may offer in regard to a
      preceding occurrence is likely to be received with suspicion, if not with
      absolute distrust. In this case, however, no opportunity was given the man
      for justifying any claim that he might advance to be credited.
    </p>
    <p>
      The proprietor assured him that he had already received an account of the
      deplorable occurrence of the night before, and that he hoped mutual
      apologies would be made in the course of the day, so that, in diplomatic
      language, the incident might be considered closed before night.
    </p>
    <p>
      The &ldquo;scratch&rdquo; man breathed again&mdash;heavily, alcoholically,
      peppermintally. And before night I managed to sticking-plaster up a peace
      between the belligerents.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of a month some busybody outside the paper had the bad taste to
      point out to the proprietor that one of the leading articles&mdash;the one
      contributed by the &ldquo;scratch&rdquo; man&mdash;in a recent issue of the paper, was
      to a word identical with one which had appeared a fortnight before in a
      Scotch paper of some importance. The &ldquo;scratch&rdquo; man explained&mdash;on
      alcohol and a clove&mdash;that the Scotch paper had copied his article.
      But the proprietor expressed his grave doubts on this point, his chief
      reason for adopting this course being that the Scotch paper with the
      article had appeared ten days previously. Then the &ldquo;scratch&rdquo; man said the
      matter was a singular, but by no means unprecedented, coincidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The proprietor opened the office door.

    <p>
      One of the most interesting of these &ldquo;casuals&rdquo; had been a clergyman (he
      said). I never was quite successful in finding out with what Church he had
      been connected, nor, although pressed for a reply, would he ever reveal to
      me how he came to find himself outside the pale of his Church&mdash;whatever
      it was. He had undoubtedly some of the mannerisms of a clergyman who is
      anxious that every one should know his profession, and he could certainly
      look out of the corners of his eyes with the best of them. Like the parson
      who is so very &ldquo;low&rdquo; that he steadily refuses to cross his t&rsquo;s lest he
      should be accused of adopting Romish emblems, he declined to turn his head
      without moving his whole body.
    </p>
    <p>
      He wore rusty cloth gloves.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was also the most adroit thief whom I ever met; and I have lived among
      some adroit ones in my time.
    </p>
    <p>
      I never read such brilliant articles as he wrote nightly&mdash;never,
      until I came upon the same articles in old files of the London newspapers,
      where they had originally appeared. The original articles from which his
      were copied <i>verbatim</i> were, I admit, quite as brilliant as his.
    </p>
    <p>
      His <i>modus operandi</i> was simplicity itself. He kept in his desk a
      series of large books for newspaper cuttings, and these were packed with
      articles on all manner of subjects, clipped from the best newspapers.
      Every day he spent an hour making these extracts, by the aid of a pot of
      paste, and indexing them on the most perfect system of double entry that
      could be conceived.
    </p>
    <p>
      At night I frequently came down to my office and found that he had written
      two columns of the most delightful essays. One might, perhaps, be on the
      subject of Moresco-Gothic Architecture and its influence on the genius of
      Velasquez, another on Battueshooting and the Acclimatisation of the Bird
      of Paradise in English coverts; but both were treated with equal grace.
      That such erudition and originality should be associated with cloth gloves
      astonished me. One day, however, the man wrote a column upon the
      decoration of one of the courts of the Alhambra, and a more picturesque
      article I never read&mdash;up to a certain point; and this point was
      reached when he commenced a new paragraph as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas! that so lovely a piece of work should have fallen a prey to the
      devastating element that laid the whole structure in ruins, and eclipsed
      the gaiety, if not of nations, at any rate of the people of London, who
      were wont to resort nightly to this Thespian temple of Leicester Square,
      feeling certain that under the liberal management of its enterprising <i>entrepreneur</i>
      some brilliant stage spectacle would be brought before their eyes. Now,
      however, that the company for the restoration of the building has been
      successfully floated, we may hope for a revival of the ancient glories of
      the Alhambra.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I inquired casually of the perpetrator of the article if he had ever heard
      of the Alhambra?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I wrote of it yesterday,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been in it; it&rsquo;s in Leicester Square.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you ever hear of another Alhambra?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I asked blandly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; there&rsquo;s one in Glasgow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you ever hear of one that wasn&rsquo;t a music-hall?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never. Maybe the temperance people give one of their new-fashioned coffee
      places the name to attract sinners on false pretences.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you ever hear of an Alhambra in Spain?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to say that they have music-halls in Spain? But why
      shouldn&rsquo;t they? Spaniards are fond of dancing, I believe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not indeed?&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day he had an explanation to offer to the chief of the staff. In
      the evening he told me that he was going to leave the paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is that?&rdquo; I inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like it,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;My ideas are cribbed, cabined, and
      confined here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are certainly cribbed,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Did you never hear of the Alhambra
      at Grenada?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never; that&rsquo;s what played the mischief with the article. You&rsquo;ll see how
      the mistake arose. There was a capital article in the <i>Telegraph</i>
      about the Alhambra&mdash;I see now that it must have referred to the one
      in Spain&mdash;about four years ago; well, I cut it out and indexed it. A
      year ago, when the Alhambra in Leicester Square was about to re-open,
      there was an article in the <i>Daily News</i>. I found it in my index
      also, and incorporated the two articles in mine. How the mischief was I to
      know that one referred to Grenada and the other to London? These writer
      chaps should be more explicit. What do they get their salaries for,
      anyway?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      I have referred to a certain resemblance existing between the unattached
      parson and the unattached editor. This resemblance is the more impressed
      on me now that, after recalling a memory of an appropriator of another
      man&rsquo;s literary work by the &ldquo;casual&rdquo; editor, I can recollect how I lived
      for some years next door to a &ldquo;casual&rdquo; parson, who had annexed a bagful of
      sermons left by his father, one of which he preached whenever he obtained
      an engagement. It was said that on receiving the usual telegram from a
      disabled rector on Saturday evening, he was accustomed to go to the
      sermon-sack, and, putting his hand down the mouth, take out a sermon with
      the same ease and confidence as are displayed by the professional
      rat-catcher in extracting from his bag one of its lively contents for the
      gratification of a terrier. It so happened, however, that upon a fine
      Sunday morning, he set out to do duty for a clergyman at a distance,
      having previously felt about the sermon-sack until he found a good fat
      roll of manuscript, which he stuffed into his pocket. He reached the
      church&mdash;in which, it should be mentioned, he had never before
      preached&mdash;and, bustling through the service with his accustomed
      celerity, ascended the pulpit and flattened out with a slap or two the
      sermon on the cushion in front of him. The sermon proved to be the
      valedictory one preached by his father in the church of which he had been
      rector for half a century. It was unquestionably a very fine effort, but
      it might seem to some people to lack local colour. Delivered in a church
      to which the preacher was a complete stranger, it had a certain amount of
      inappropriateness about it which might reasonably be expected to diminish
      from its effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a solemn moment for us all, my dear, dear friends. It is a solemn
      moment for you, but ah! how much more solemn for me! Sunday after Sunday
      for the past fifty years I have stood in the pulpit where I stand to-day
      to preach the Gospel of Truth. I see before me now the well-known faces of
      my flock. Those who were young when I first came among you are now well
      stricken in years. Some whom I baptised as infants, have brought their
      infants to me to be baptised; these in turn have been spared to bring
      their infants to be admitted into the membership of the Church Militant.
      For fifty years have I not taken part in your joys and your sorrows, and
      now who shall say that the hour of parting should not be bitter? I see
      tears on the faces before me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the funny part of the matter was that he did. No one present seemed to
      see anything inappropriate in the sermon; and at the pathetic references
      to the hour of parting, there was not a dry eye in the church&mdash;except
      the remarkably bright pair possessed by a female scoffer, who told the
      story to me. It was not to be expected that the clergyman would become
      aware of the mistake&mdash;if it was a mistake&mdash;that he had made: he
      had for years been a preaching machine, and had become as devoid of
      feeling as a barrel organ; but it seemed to me incredible that only one
      person in the church should discover the ludicrous aspect of the
      situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      So I remarked to my informant, and she said that it was all the same a
      fact that the people were weeping copiously on all sides.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I asked the doctor&rsquo;s wife the next day what she thought of the sermon,&rdquo;
       added my informant, &ldquo;and she replied with a sigh that it was beautifully
      touching; and when I put it straight to her if she did not think it was
      queer for a clergyman who was a total stranger to us to say that he had
      occupied the pulpit for fifty years, she replied, &lsquo;Ah, my dear, you&rsquo;re too
      matter of fact: sermons should not be taken too literally. <i>You should
      make allowance for the parsons imagination</i>.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It is told of the same &ldquo;casual&rdquo; that an attempt was made to get the better
      of him by a parsimonious set of churchwardens upon the occasion of his
      being engaged to do duty for the regular parson of the parish. The
      contract made with the &ldquo;casual&rdquo; was to perform the service and preach the
      sermon in the morning for the sum of two guineas. He turned up in good
      time on the Sunday morning and performed his part of the contract in a
      business-like way. In the vestry, after he had preached the sermon, he was
      waited on by the senior churchwarden, who handed him his fee and expressed
      the great satisfaction felt by the churchwardens at the manner in which
      the work had been executed. He added that as the clergyman&rsquo;s train would
      not leave the village until half-past eight at night, perhaps the reverend
      gentleman would not mind dining with him, the senior churchwarden, and
      performing a short evening service at six o&rsquo;clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will suit me very well indeed,&rdquo; said the reverend gentleman. &ldquo;I
      thank you very much for your hospitable offer. I charge thirty shillings
      for an evening service with sermon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The hospitable churchwarden replied that he feared the resources of the
      church would not be equal to such a strain upon them. He thought that the
      clergyman might not object under the circumstances to give his services
      gratis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you dispose of your excellent cheeses gratis?&rdquo; asked the clergyman
      courteously. The churchwarden was in the cheese business.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, no, of course not,&rdquo; laughed the churchwarden. &ldquo;But still&mdash;well,
      suppose we say a guinea for the evening service?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s my charge for the service, leaving out the sermon,&rdquo; said the
      clergyman.
    </p>
    <p>
      He explained that it was the cheapest thing in the market at the time. It
      was done with only the smallest margin of profit. Allowing for the wear
      and tear, it left hardly anything for himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The churchwarden shook his head. He feared that they would not be able to
      trade on the terms, he said. Suddenly, however, he brightened up. Could
      the reverend gentleman not give them a good, sound, second quality sermon?
      he inquired. They did not expect an A-1, copper-fastened, platinum-tipped,
      bevelled-edged, full-calf sermon for the money; but hadn&rsquo;t the reverend
      gentleman a sound, clump-soled, celluloid-faced, nickel-plated sermon&mdash;something
      evangelical that would do very well for one evening?
    </p>
    <p>
      The clergyman replied that he had nothing of the sort in stock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, at any rate, you will say a few words to the congregation&mdash;not
      a sermon, you know&mdash;after the service, for the guinea?&rdquo; suggested the
      churchwarden.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, I&rsquo;ll say a few words, if that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; said the clergyman.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he did.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had got to that grand old Amen which closes the Evening Service,
      he stood up and said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear brethren, there will be no sermon preached here this evening.&rdquo;
     </p>

      Having entered upon the perilous path that is strewn with stories of
      clergymen, I cannot leave it without recalling certain negotiations which
      a prelate once opened with me for the purchase of an article of furniture
      that remained at the palace when he was translated (with footnotes in the
      vernacular by local tradesmen) to a new episcopate. I have always had a
      weakness for collecting antique carved oak, and the prelate, being aware
      of this, called my attention to what he termed an &ldquo;antique carved oak
      cabinet,&rdquo; which occupied an alcove in the hall. He said he thought that I
      might be glad to have a chance of purchasing it, for he himself did not
      wish to be put to the trouble of conveying it to his new home&mdash;if a
      palace can be called a home. Now, there had been a three days&rsquo; auction at
      the palace where the antiquity remained, and, apparently, all the dealers
      had managed to resist the temptation that was offered them of acquiring a
      rare specimen of old oak; but, assuming that the dignitary had placed a
      high reserve price upon it from which he might now be disposed to abate, I
      replied that it would please me greatly to buy the cabinet if it was not
      too large. By appointment I accompanied a seemingly meek domestic chaplain
      to the dis-.mantled palace; and there, sure enough, in a dark alcove of
      the long and narrow hall&mdash;for the palace was not palatial&mdash;I saw
      (dimly) a huge thing like a wardrobe with pillars, or it might have been a
      loose box, or perhaps a bedstead gone wrong, or a dismantled hearse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a dreadful thing,&rdquo; I remarked to the meek chaplain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dreadful, indeed,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s antique carved oak, so I suppose
      it&rsquo;s a treasure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you a match about you?&rdquo; I asked, for the place was very dark.
    </p>
    <p>
      The meek chaplain looked scandalised&mdash;it was light enough to allow of
      my seeing that&mdash;at the suggestion that he carried matches. He said he
      thought he knew where some might be had. He walked to the end of the
      passage, and I saw him take out a box of matches from a pocket. He came
      back, saying he recollected having seen the box on a ledge &ldquo;down there.&rdquo; I
      struck a match and held the light close to the fabric. I gave a portion of
      it a little scrape with my knife, and then tested the carving by the same
      implement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did his lordship describe this?&rdquo; I inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He said it was antique carved oak,&rdquo; said the meek chaplain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you ever hear of Cuvier and the lobster?&rdquo; I inquired further.
    </p>
    <p>
      He said he never had.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That being so, I may venture to say that his lordship&rsquo;s description of
      this thing is an excellent one,&rdquo; I remarked; &ldquo;only that it is not antique,
      it is not carved, and it is not oak.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; asked the meek chaplain..
    </p>
    <p>
      I struck another match, and showed him the white patch that I had scraped
      with my knife, and he admitted that old oak was not usually white beneath
      the surface. I showed him also where the carving had sprung up before the
      point of my knife, making plain the &lsquo;fact that the carving had been glued
      to the fabric.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His lordship got that made by a local carpenter twenty-five years ago,&rdquo;
       said I; &ldquo;and yet he tries to sell it to me for antique carved oak. It
      strikes me that in Wardour Street he would find a congenial episcopate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The meek chaplain stroked his chin reflectively; then, putting his
      umbrella under one arm, he joined the tips of his fingers, saying,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whatever unworthy doubts I may once have entertained on the difficult
      subject of Apostolic succession are now, thank God, set at rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; I inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it possible,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;that you do not perceive how strong an
      argument this incident furnishes in favour of our Church&rsquo;s claim to the
      Apostolic succession of her bishops?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I shook my head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;St. Peter was a Jew,&rdquo; said the meek chaplain.
    </p>

      Another of the casual ward of editors who appears on the tablets of my
      memory was a gentleman who came from Wales&mdash;and a large number of
      other places. He had a rooted objection to write anything new; but he was
      the best literary tinker I ever met. In Spitzhagen&rsquo;s story, &ldquo;Sturmfluth,&rdquo;
       there is a most amusing account of the sculptor who made the statues of
      distinguished Abstractions, which he had carved in his young days, do duty
      for memorial commissions of lately-departed heroes. A bust of Homer he had
      no difficulty in transforming into one of Germania weeping for her sons
      killed in the war, and so forth. The sculptor&rsquo;s talent was the same as
      that of the editor. He had the draft of about fifty articles, and three
      obituary notices. These he managed to tinker up, chipping a bit off here
      and there, and giving prominence to other portions, until his purpose of
      the moment was served. I have seen him turn an article that purported to
      show the absurdity of free trade, into an attack upon the Irish policy of
      the Government; and in the twinkling of an eye upon another occasion he
      made one on the Panama swindle do duty for one on the compulsory rescue of
      Emin by Stanley. With only a change of a line or, two, the obituary notice
      of Gambetta was that which he had used for Garibaldi; and yet when the
      Emperor Frederick died, it was the same article that was furbished up for
      the occasion. Every local medical man who died was dealt with in the
      appreciative article which he had written some years before on the death
      of Sir William Gull; and the influence of the career of every just
      deceased local philanthropist was described in the words (slightly altered
      to suit topography) that had been written for the Earl of Shaftesbury.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was really little short of marvellous how this system worked. It was a
      tinker&rsquo;s triumph.
    </p>
    <p>
      I must supplement my recollections of these worthies by a few lines
      regarding a man of the same type who, I believe, never put pen to paper
      without being guilty of some extraordinary error. A high compliment was
      paid to me, I felt, when I had assigned to me, as part of my duties, the
      reading of his proof sheets nightly. In everyone that I ever read I found
      some monstrous mistake; and as he was old enough to be my grandfather, and
      extremely sensitive besides, I was completely exhausted by my expenditure
      of tact in pointing out to him what I called his &ldquo;little inaccuracies.&rdquo;
       One night he laid his proof sheet before me, saying triumphantly, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll
      not find any of the usual slips in that, I&rsquo;m thinking. I&rsquo;ve managed to
      write one leader correct at last.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I read the thing he had written. It referred to a letter which Mr. Bence
      Jones had contributed to <i>The Times</i> on the subject of the Irish Land
      League Agitation. After commenting on this letter, he wound up by saying
      that Mr. Bence Jones had proved himself to be as practical an
      agriculturalist as he was an expert painter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you certain that Bence Jones is a painter?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As certain as I can be of anything,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen his work
      referred to dozens of times. I believe there&rsquo;s a picture of his in the
      Grosvenor Gallery this very year. I thought you knew all about
      contemporary art,&rdquo; he added, with a sneer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Art is long,&rdquo; said I, searching for a Grosvenor Gallery catalogue, which
      I knew I had thrown among my books. &ldquo;Now, will you just turn up the
      picture you say you saw noticed, and I&rsquo;ll admit that you know more than I
      do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I handed him the catalogue. He adjusted his spectacles, looked at the
      index, gave a triumphant &ldquo;Ha! I have you now,&rdquo; and forthwith turned up
      &ldquo;The Golden Stair,&rdquo; by E. <i>Burne</i> Jones.

    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>T would give me no
      difficulty to write a book about sub-editors with illustrations from those
      whom I have met. It is, perhaps, in this department of a newspaper office
      that the change from the old <i>regime</i> is most apparent. The young
      sub-editors are frequently graduates of universities; but, in spite of
      this, most of them are well abreast of French and German as well as
      English literature. They bear out my contention, that journalism is
      beginning to be taken seriously. The new men have chosen journalism as
      their profession; they have not, as was the case with the men of a past
      age, merely drifted into journalism because they were failures in banks,
      in tailors&rsquo; shops, in the drapery line, and even in the tobacco business&mdash;one
      in which failure is almost impossible.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have met in the old days with specimens of such men&mdash;men who
      fancied, and who got their employers to fancy also, that because they had
      failed in occupations that demanded the exercise of no intellectual powers
      for success, they were bound to succeed in something that they termed &ldquo;a
      literary calling.&rdquo; They did not succeed as a rule. They glanced over their
      column or two of telegraphic news,&mdash;in those days few provincial
      papers contained more than a double column of telegrams,&mdash;they
      glanced through the country correspondence and corrected such mistakes in
      grammar as they were able to detect: it was with the scissors and paste,
      however, that their most striking intellectual work was done. In this
      department the brilliancy of the old sub-editor&rsquo;s genius had a chance of
      being displayed. It coruscated, so to speak, on the rim of the paste pot,
      and played upon the business angle of the scissors, as the St. Elmo&rsquo;s
      light gleams on the yard-arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said one of them to me, with a glow of proper pride upon his face,
      as he ran the closed scissors between the pages of the <i>Globe</i>. &ldquo;Ah,
      it&rsquo;s only when it comes to a question of cutting out that your true
      sub-editor reveals himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he forthwith annexed the &ldquo;turn-over,&rdquo; without so much as acquainting
      himself with the nature of the column.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you never read the thing before you cut it out?&rdquo; I inquired timidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He smiled the smile of the professor at the innocent question of a tyro.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not likely, young fellow,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s bad enough to have to read
      all the cuttings when they appear in our next issue, without reading them
      beforehand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then how do you know whether or not the thing that you cut out is
      suitable for the paper?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s where the instinct of your true subeditor comes in,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I
      put in the point of the scissors mechanically and the right thing is sure
      to come between the blades.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In a few minutes he had about thirty columns of cuttings ready for the
      foreman printer.
    </p>
    <p>
      I began to feel that I had never done full justice to the sub-editor or
      the truffle hunter.

    <hr />
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      I have said that in those old days not more than two columns of wired news
      ever came to any provincial paper&mdash;<i>The Scotsman</i>, the <i>Glasgow
      Herald</i>, and a Liverpool and Manchester organ excepted. The private
      wire had not yet been heard of. In the present day, however, I have seen
      as many as sixteen columns of telegraphic news in a very ordinary
      provincial paper. I myself have come into my office at ten o&rsquo;clock to find
      a speech in &ldquo;flimsy,&rdquo; of four columns in length, on some burning question
      of the moment. I have read through all this matter, and placing it in the
      printers&rsquo; hands by eleven, I have written a column of comment (about one
      thousand eight hundred words), read a proof of this column and started for
      home at half-past one. I may mention that while waiting for the last slips
      of my proof, I also made myself aware of the contents of the <i>Times</i>,
      the <i>Telegraph</i>, the <i>Standard</i>, and the <i>Morning Post</i>,
      which had arrived by the midnight train.
    </p>
    <p>
      I suppose there are hundreds of editors throughout the provinces to whom
      such a programme is habitually no more a thing to shrink from than it was
      to me for several years of my life. But I am sure that if any one of the
      sub-editors of the old days had been required to read even five columns of
      a political speech, and eight of parliament, he would have talked about
      slave-driving and a &ldquo;dorg&rsquo;s life&rdquo; until he had fallen asleep&mdash;as he
      frequently did&mdash;with his arms on his desk and the &ldquo;flimsies&rdquo; on the
      floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some time ago I was in London, and had written an article at my rooms,
      with a view of putting it on the special wire at the Fleet Street end for
      transmission to the newspaper on which I was then employed. It so
      happened, however, that I was engaged at other matters much longer than I
      expected to be that night, so that it was past one o&rsquo;clock in the morning
      when I drove to the office in Fleet Street. The lower door was shut, and
      no response was given to my ring. I knew that the editor had gone home,
      but of course the telegraph operator was still in his room&mdash;I could
      see his light in the topmost window&mdash;and I made up my mind to rouse
      him, for I assumed that he was taking his usual sleep. After ringing the
      bell twice without result, it suddenly occurred to me that I might place
      myself in connection with him by some other means than the bell-wire. I
      drove to the Central Telegraph Office, and sent a telegram to the operator
      at the Irish end of the special wire, asking him to arouse the Fleet
      Street operator and tell him to open the street door for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I returned to Fleet Street I found the operator waiting for me at the
      open door. In other words, I found that my easiest plan of communicating
      with the third floor from the street was by means of an office in Ireland.
    </p>
    <p>
      I do not think that any of the old-time subeditors would have been likely
      to anticipate the arrival of a day when such an incident would be
      possible.

      The only modern man of the old school, so to speak, with whom I came in
      contact at the outset of my journalistic life, now occupies one of the
      highest places on the London Press. I have never met so able a man since I
      worked by his side, nor have I ever met with one who was so accurate an
      observer, or so unerring a judge of men. He was everything that a
      subeditor should be, and if he erred at all it was on the side of
      courtesy. I have known of men coming down to the office with an action for
      libel in their hearts, and bitterness surpassing the bitterness of a
      Thomson whose name has appeared with a p, in the account of the attendance
      at a funeral, and yet going back to their wives and families quite genial,
      owing to the attitude adopted toward them by this subeditor; yes, and
      without any offer being made by him to have the mistake, of which they
      usually complained, altered in the next issue.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was one of the few men whom I have known to go to London from the
      provinces with a doubt on his mind as to his future success. Most of those
      to whom I have said a farewell that, unfortunately, proved to be only
      temporary, had made up their minds to seek the metropolis on account of
      the congenial extent of the working area of that city. A provincial town
      of three hundred thousand inhabitants had a cramping effect upon them,
      they carefully assured me; the fact being that any place except London was
      little better than a kennel&mdash;usually a good deal worse..
    </p>
    <p>
      I have come to the conclusion, from thinking over this matter, that,
      although self-confidence may be a valuable quality on the part of a
      pressman, it should not be cultivated to the exclusion of all other
      virtues.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gentleman to whom I refer is now managing editor of his paper, and
      spends a large portion of his hardly-purchased leisure hours answering
      letters that have been written to him by literary aspirants in his native
      town. One of them writes a pamphlet to prove that there never has been and
      never shall be a hell, and he sends it to be dealt with on the following
      morning in a leader in the leading London newspaper. He, it seems, has to
      be written to&mdash;kindly, but firmly. Another wishes a poem&mdash;not on
      a death in the Royal Family&mdash;to be printed, if possible, between the
      summary and the first leader; a third reminds the managing editor that
      when sub-editor of the provincial paper eleven years before, he inserted a
      letter on the disgraceful state of the footpath on one of the local
      thoroughfares, and hopes that, now that the same gentleman is at the head
      of a great metropolitan organ, he will assist him, his correspondent, in
      the good work which has been inaugurated. The footpath is as bad as ever,
      he explains. But it is over courteously repressive letters to such young
      men&mdash;and old men too&mdash;as hope he may see his way to give them
      immediate and lucrative employment on his staff, that most of his spare
      time and all his spare stamps are spent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ladies write to him by the hundred&mdash;for it seems that any one may
      become a lady journalist&mdash;making valuable suggestions to him by means
      of which he may, if he chooses, obtain daily a chatty column with local
      social sketches, every one guaranteed to be taken from life.
    </p>
    <p>
      He doesn&rsquo;t choose.
    </p>
    <p>
      The consequence is that the ladies write to him again without the loss of
      a post, and assure him that if he fancies his miserable paper is anything
      but the laughing-stock of humanity, he takes an absurdly optimistic view
      of the result of his labours in connection with it.

      About five years after he had left the town where we had been located

      &ldquo;We had a long talk together,&rdquo; said the man, recording the transaction,
      &ldquo;and I was surprised to find how completely he has severed all his former
      connections and old associations. I mentioned casually the names of some
      of the most prominent of the people here, but he had difficulty in
      recalling them. Why, actually&mdash;you&rsquo;ll scarcely believe it&mdash;when
      I spoke of Sir Alexander Henderson, he asked who was he! It&rsquo;s a positive
      fact!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now Sir Alexander Henderson was a Town Councillor.

      The provincial successor to the sub-editor just referred to was
      undoubtedly a remarkable man. He was a Plymouth Brother, and without
      guile. He was, for some reason or other, very anxious that I should join
      &ldquo;The Church&rdquo; also. I might have done so if I had succeeded in discovering
      what were the precise doctrines held by the body. But it would seem that
      the theology of the Plymouth Brethren is not an exact science. A Plymouth
      Brother is one who accepts the doctrines of the Plymouth Brethren. So much
      I learned, and no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      He possessed a certain amount of confidence in the correctness of his
      views&mdash;whatever they may have been, and he never allowed any pressman
      to enter his room without writing a summary on some subject; for which, it
      may be mentioned, he himself got credit in the eyes of the proprietor. He
      had no singing voice whatsoever, but his views on the Second Advent were
      so deep as to force him to give vocal expression to them thus:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Parlando. The Lord shall come. Will you write me a bit of a summary?&rdquo;

      The request to anyone who chanced to be in the room with him, following so
      hard upon the vocal assertion of the most solemn of his theological
      tenets, had a shocking effect; more especially as the newspaper offices in
      those old days were constantly filled with shallow scoffers and sceptics;
      and, of course, persons were not wanting who endeavoured to evade their
      task by assuring him that the Sacred Event was not one that could be
      legitimately treated within a lesser space than a full column.
    </p>
    <p>
      He usually offered to discuss with me at 2 a.m. such subjects as the
      Immortality of the Soul or the Inspiration of Holy Writ. When he would
      signify his intention of proving both questions, if I would only wait for
      four hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was accustomed to adopt the attitude of the schoolboy who, when the
      schoolmaster, after drawing sundry lines on the blackboard, asserted that
      the square described upon the diagonal of a double rectangular
      parallelogram was equal to double the rectangle described upon the other
      two sides, and offered to prove it, said, &ldquo;Pray don&rsquo;t trouble yourself,
      sir; I don&rsquo;t doubt it in the least.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I assured the sub-editor that there was nothing in the somewhat extensive
      range of theological belief that I wouldn&rsquo;t admit at 2 a.m. after a long
      night&rsquo;s work.

      The most amusing experience was that which I had with the same gentleman
      at the time of the Eastern crises of the spring of 1878. During the
      previous year he had accustomed himself to close his nightly summary of
      the progress of the war between Russia and Turkey and the possibility of
      complications arising with England, with these words:&mdash;&ldquo;Fortunate
      indeed it is that at the present moment we have at our Foreign Office so
      sagacious and far-seeing a statesman as Earl Derby. Every confidence may
      be reposed in his judgment to avert the crisis which in all probability is
      impending.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Certainly once a week did this summary appear in the paper, until I fancy
      the readers began to tire of it. As events developed early in the spring,
      the paragraph was inserted with feverish frequency. He was at it again one
      night&mdash;I could hear him murmur the words to himself as he went over
      the thing&mdash;but the moment he had given out the copy I threw down in
      front of him a telegram which I had just opened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will make a good summary,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;The Reserves are called out and
      Lord Derby has resigned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sprang to his feet, exclaiming, like the blameless George, &ldquo;What&mdash;what&mdash;what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s the flimsy,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good riddance. He never was worth
      much. The idea of a conscientious Minister at the Foreign Office! Now
      Beaconsfield will have a free hand. You&rsquo;d better write that summary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will&mdash;I will,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But I think I&rsquo;ll ask you to dictate it to
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Heave ahead. &lsquo;The news of the resignation of Earl
      Derby will be received by the public of Great Britain with feelings akin
      to those of relief.... The truth is that for several months past it was
      but too plain to even the least sagacious persons that Lord Derby at the
      Foreign Office was the one weakness in the <i>personnel</i> of the
      Ministry. In colloquial, parlance he was the square peg in the round hole.
      Now that his resignation has been accepted we may say farewell, a long
      farewell, to a feeble and vacillating Minister of whose capacity at such a
      serious crisis we have frequently thought it our duty to express our grave
      doubts.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took a shorthand note of this stuff, which he transcribed, and ordered
      to be set up in place of the first summary. For the next three months that
      original metaphor of the square peg and the round hole appeared in
      relation to Lord Derby once a week in the political summary.

      Among the minor peculiarities of this subeditor of the old time was an
      apparently irresistible desire for the companionship of his wife at
      nights. Perhaps, however, I am doing him an injustice, and the evidence
      available on this point should only be accepted as indicating the desire
      of his wife for the companionship of her husband. At any rate, for some
      reason or other, the lady occupied an honoured place in her husband&rsquo;s room
      certainly three nights every week.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pair never exchanged a word for the six or seven hours that they
      remained together. Perhaps here again I am doing one of them an injustice,
      for I now remember that during at least two hours out of every night the
      door of the room was locked on the inside, so they may have been making up
      their arrears of silence by discussing the immortality of the soul, or
      other delicate theological points, during this &ldquo;close&rdquo; season.
    </p>
    <p>
      The foreman printer was the only one in the office who was in the habit of
      complaining about the presence of the lady in the sub-editor&rsquo;s room. He
      was the rudest-voiced man and the most untiring user of oaths ever known
      even among foremen printers, and this is saying a great deal. He explained
      to me in language that was by no means deficient in force, that the
      presence of the lady had a cramping and enervating effect upon him when he
      went to tell the sub-editor that he needn&rsquo;t send out any more &ldquo;copy,&rdquo; as
      the paper was overset. How could any conscientious foreman do himself
      justice under such circumstances? he asked me.

      The same sub-editor had a ghost story. He was the only man whom I ever met
      who believed in his own ghost story. I have come in contact with several
      men who had ghost stories in their <i>répertoire</i>, but I never met any
      but this one who was idiot enough to believe in the story that he had to
      tell. I am sorry that I cannot remember its many details. But the truth is
      that it made no more impression on me than the usual ghost story makes
      upon a man with a sound digestion. As a means of earning a livelihood the
      journalistic &ldquo;spook&rdquo; occupies a legitimate place among the other devices
      of modern enterprise to effect the same praiseworthy object; but a
      personal and unprofessional belief in the possibility of the existence in
      visible form of a &ldquo;ghost&rdquo; is the evidence either of a mind
      constitutionally adapted to the practice of imposture, or of a remarkable
      capacity for being imposed upon. My friend the sub-editor had not a heart
      for falsehood framed, so I believed that he believed that he had seen the
      spirit of his father make an effective exit from the apartment where the
      father had died. This was, I recollect, the foundation of his story. I
      remember also that the spirit took the form of a small but compact ball of
      fire, and that it rolled up the spout&mdash;on the outside&mdash;and then
      broke into a thousand stars.
    </p>
    <p>
      The description of the incident suggested a lesser triumph of Messrs.
      Brock at the Crystal Palace rather than the account of the solution of the
      greatest mystery that man ever has faced or ever can face. When I had
      heard the story to the end&mdash;up to the moment that the old nurse came
      out of the house crying, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s gone, he&rsquo;s gone!&rdquo; preparatory to throwing
      her apron over her head&mdash;I merely asked,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How many nights did you say you had been watching by your father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t think that I said anything to you about
      watching.&rdquo; Neither had he. Like the witness at the mysterious murder trial
      who didn&rsquo;t think it worth while mentioning to the police that he had seen
      a man, who had a grudge against the deceased, leaving the room where the
      body was found, and carrying in one hand a long knife dripping with blood,
      my friend did not think that the circumstance of his having had no sleep
      for three nights had any bearing upon the question of the accuracy of his
      eyesight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course I merely said that the story was an extraordinary one.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have noticed that Plymouth Brotherhood, vegetarianism, soft hats, bad
      art, and a belief in at least one ghost usually are found associated.
    </p>
    <p>
      This sub-editor emigrated several years ago to the South Sea Islands with
      evangelistic intentions. On his departure his colleagues made him a
      graceful and appropriate gift which could not fail to cause him to recall
      in after years the many pleasant hours they had spent together.
    </p>
    <p>
      It took the form of an immense marble chimney-piece clock, weighing about
      a hundredweight and a half, and looking uncomfortably like an
      eighteenth-century mural tomb. It was such a nice present to make to an
      evangelist in the neophyte stage, every one thought; for what the gig was
      in the forties as a guarantee of all that was genteel, the massive marble
      clock was in the eyes of the past generation of journalists. I happen to
      know something about the sunny islands of the South Pacific and their
      inhabitants, and it has often occurred to me that the guarantees of
      gentility which find universal acceptance where the hibiscus blooms, may
      not be wholly identical with those that were in vogue among journalists
      long ago. Should these unworthy doubts which now and again occur to me
      when I am alone, be well founded, I fear that the presentation to my
      friend may repose elsewhere than on a chimney-piece of Upolu or Tahiti.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a matter of fact, I read a short time ago an account of a remarkable
      head-dress worn by a native chief, which struck me as having many points
      in common with a massive dining-room marble clock.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>NOTHER remarkable
      type of the subeditor of the past was a middle-aged man whom it was my
      privilege to study for some months. No one could account for a curious <i>distrait</i>
      air which he frequently wore; but I had only to look at his eyes to become
      aware of the secret of his life. I had seen enough of opium smokers in the
      East to enable me to pronounce decisively on this &ldquo;case.&rdquo; He was a most
      intelligent and widely-read man; but he had wrecked his life over opium.
      He could not live without it, and with it he was utterly unfit for any
      work. Night after night I did the wretched man&rsquo;s work while he lay in a
      corner of the room wandering through the opium eater&rsquo;s paradise. After
      some months he vanished, utterly from the town, and I never found a trace
      of him elsewhere.

      He was much to be preferred to a curious Scotsman who succeeded him. It
      was not the effects of opium that caused this person to lie in a corner
      and babble o&rsquo; green fields upon certain occasions, such as the anniversary
      of the birth of Robert Burns, the anniversary of the death of the same
      poet, the celebration of the Annual Festival of St. Andrew, the Annual
      Dinner of the Caledonian Society, the Anniversary Supper of the Royal
      Scottish Association, the Banquet and Ball of the Sons of Scotia, the
      &ldquo;Nicht wi&rsquo; Our Ain Kin,&rdquo; the Ancient Golf Dinner, the Curlers&rsquo; Reunion,
      the &ldquo;Rink and Drink&rdquo; of the &ldquo;Free Bowlers&rdquo;&mdash;a local festival&mdash;the
      Pipe and Bagpipe of the Clans Awa&rsquo; Frae Harne&mdash;another local club of
      Caledonians. Each of these celebrations of the representatives of his
      nation, which took place in the town to which he came&mdash;I need
      scarcely say it was not in Scotland&mdash;was attended by him; hence the
      babbling o&rsquo; green fields between the hours of one and three a.m. He
      babbled once too often, and was sent forth to fresh fields by his
      employer, who was not a &ldquo;brither Scot.&rdquo; I daresay he is babbling up to the
      present hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of the well-known and deeply-rooted prejudices of the Scottish
      nation against the spirit of what may be termed racial cohesion, it cannot
      be denied that they have been known now and again to display a tendency&mdash;when
      outside Scotland&mdash;to localise certain of their national institutions.
      They do so at considerable self-sacrifice, and the result is never
      otherwise than beneficial to the locality operated on. No more adequately
      attested narrative has been recorded than that of the two Shanghai
      merchants&mdash;Messrs. Andrew Gareloch and Alexander MacClackan&mdash;who
      were unfortunate enough to be wrecked on the voyage to England. They were
      the sole survivors of the ship&rsquo;s company, and the island upon which they
      found themselves was in the middle of the Pacific, and about six miles
      long by four across. In the lagoon were plenty of fish, and on the ridge
      of the slope cocoanuts, loquats, plantains, and sweet potatoes were
      growing, so that there was no question as to their supplies holding out.
      After a good meal they determined that their first duty was to name the
      island. They called it St. Andrew Lang Syne Island, and became as festive
      and brotherly&mdash;they pronounced it &ldquo;britherly&rdquo;&mdash;as was possible
      over cocoanut milk: it was a long time since either of them had tasted
      milk. The second day they founded a local Benevolent Society of St.
      Andrew, and held the inaugural dinner; the third day they founded a Burns
      Club, and inaugurated the undertaking with a supper; the fourth day they
      started a Scottish Association, and with it a series of monthly reunions
      for the discussion of Scotch ballad literature; the fifth day they laid
      out a golf links with the finest bunkers in the world, and instituted a
      club lunch (strictly non-alcoholic); the sixth day they formed a Curling
      Club&mdash;the lagoon would make a braw rink, they said, if it only froze;
      if it didn&rsquo;t freeze, well, they could still have the annual Curlers&rsquo; 
      supper&mdash;and they had it; the Seventh Day they <i>kept</i>. On the
      evening of the same day a vessel was sighted bearing up for the island;
      but, of course, neither of the men would hoist a signal on the Seventh
      Day, and they watched the craft run past the island, though they were
      amazed to find that she had only her courses and a foresail set, in spite
      of the fact that the breeze was a light one. The next morning, when they
      were sitting together at breakfast discussing whether they should lay the
      foundation stone&mdash;with a commemorative lunch&mdash;of a free kirk, a
      U.P. meeting-house, or an Auld Licht meeting-house&mdash;they had been
      fiercely discussing the merits of each at every spare moment during the
      previous twenty years at Shanghai&mdash;they saw the vessel returning with
      all sail set and a signal flying. To run up one of their shirts to a pole
      at the entrance to the lagoon was a matter of a moment, and they saw that
      their signal was responded to. Sail was taken off the ship, she was
      steered by signals from the shore through the entrance to the lagoons and
      dropped anchor.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned out to be the <i>Bonnie Doon</i>, of Dundee, Douglas Mackellar,
      master. He had found portions of wreckage floating at sea, and had thought
      it possible that some of the survivors of the wreck might want passages
      &ldquo;hame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nae, nae,&rdquo; said both the men, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re no in need o&rsquo; passages hame just the
      noo. But what for did ye no mak&rsquo; for the passage yestere&rsquo;en in the
      gloaming?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; said Captain Mackellar, &ldquo;I ran by aboot the mirk; but hoot awa&rsquo;&mdash;hoot
      awa&rsquo;, ye wouldn&rsquo;t hae me come ashore on the Sawbath Day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye shortened sail, tho&rsquo;,&rdquo; remarked Mr. MacClackan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, on Saturday nicht. I never let her do more than just sail on the
      Sawbath. Why the eevil didn&rsquo;t ye run up a bit signal, ye loons, if ye
      spied me sae weel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hoot awa&rsquo;&mdash;hoot awa&rsquo;, ye wouldn&rsquo;t hae us mak&rsquo; a signal on the
      Sawbath day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Na&rsquo;, na&rsquo;, no regular signal; but ye might hae run up a wee bittie&mdash;just
      eneugh tae catch my e&rsquo;en. Ay, an&rsquo; will ye nae come aboard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll hae to talk owre it, Captain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Well; they did talk over the matter, cautiously and discreetly, for a few
      hours, for Captain Mackellar was a hard man at a bargain, and he would not
      agree to give them a passage at anything less than two pound a head. At
      last negotiations were concluded, the men got aboard the <i>Bonnie Doon</i>
      and piloted her out of the lagoon. They reached the Clyde in safety,
      having on the voyage found that Captain Mackellar was a religious man and
      never used any but the most God-fearing of oaths at his crew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Weel, ma freends,&rdquo; said he, as they approached Greenock&mdash;&ldquo;Weel, I&rsquo;m
      in hopes that ye&rsquo;ll be paying me the siller this e&rsquo;en.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, mon, that we will, certes,&rdquo; said the passengers. &ldquo;In the meantime,
      we&rsquo;d tak&rsquo; the liberty o&rsquo; calling your attention to a wee bit claim we hae
      japped doon on a bit slip o&rsquo; paper. It&rsquo;s three poon nine for harbour dues
      that ye owe us, Captain Mackellar, and twa poon ten for pilotage&mdash;it&rsquo;s
      compulsory at yon island, so maybe ye&rsquo;ll mak&rsquo; it convenient to hand us
      owre the differs when we land. Ay, Douglas Mackellar, ye shouldn&rsquo;a try to
      get the better o&rsquo; brither Scots.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Douglas Mackellar was a God-fearing man, but he said &ldquo;Dom!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I once had some traffic with a newspaper office that had suffered from a
      border raid. In the month of June a managing editor had been imported from
      the Clyde, and although previously no &ldquo;hand&rdquo; from north of the Tweed had
      ever been located within its walls, yet before December had come, to take
      a stroll through any department of that office was like taking a walk down
      Sauchiehall Street, or the Broomielaw. The foreman printer used weird
      Scotch oaths, and his son was the &ldquo;devil&rdquo;&mdash;pronounced <i>deevil</i>.
      His brother-in-law was the day foreman, and his brother-in-law&rsquo;s son was a
      junior clerk. The stereotyper was the stepson of the night foreman&rsquo;s
      mother, and he had a nephew who was the machinist, with a brother for his
      assistant. The managing editor&rsquo;s brother was sub-editor, and the man to
      whom his wife had been engaged before she married him, was
      assistant-editor. The assistant-editor&rsquo;s uncle became the head of the
      advertising department, and he had three sons; two of them became clerks
      with progressive salaries, and the third became the chief reporter, also
      with a progressive salary. In fact, the paper became a one-family show&mdash;it
      was like a &ldquo;nicht wi&rsquo; Burns,&rdquo;&mdash;and no paper was ever worked better.
      It never paid less than fifteen per cent.
    </p>
    <p>
      A rather more amusing experience was of the overrunning of a newspaper
      office by the wild Irishry. The organ in question had a somewhat chequered
      career during the ten months that it existed. At one period&mdash;for even
      as long as a month&mdash;it was understood to pay its expenses; but when
      it failed to pay its expenses, no one else paid them; hence in time it
      came to be looked upon as a rather unsound property. The original editor,
      a man of ability and culture, declined to be dictated to in some delicate
      political question by the proprietor, and took his departure without going
      through the empty formality&mdash;it was, after all, only a point of
      etiquette&mdash;of asking for the salary that was due to him. For some
      weeks the paper was run&mdash;if something that scarcely crawled could be
      said to be run&mdash;without an editor; then a red-headed Irishman of the
      Namgay Doola type appeared&mdash;like a meteor surrounded by a nimbus of
      brogue&mdash;in the editor&rsquo;s room. His name was O&rsquo;Keegan, but lest this
      name might be puzzling to the English nation, he weakly gave in to their
      prejudices and simplified it into O&rsquo;Geogheghoiran. He was a Master of Arts
      of the Royal University in Ireland, and a winner of gold medals for Greek
      composition, as well as philosophy. He said he had passed at one time at
      the head of the list of Indian Civil Service candidates, but was rejected
      by the doctor on account of his weak lungs. When I met him his lungs had
      apparently overcome whatever weakness they may once have had. He had a
      colloquial acquaintance with Sanscrit, and he had also been one of the
      best billiard markers in all Limerick.
    </p>
    <p>
      I fancy he knew something about every science and art, except the art and
      science of editing a daily newspaper on which the payment of salaries was
      intermittent. In the course of a week a man from Galway had taken the
      vacant and slightly injured chair of the sub-editor, a man from Waterford
      said he had been appointed chief of the reporting staff, a man from
      Tipperary said he was the new art editor and musical critic, and a man
      from Kilkenny said he had been invited by his friend Mr. O&rsquo;Geogheghoiran
      to &ldquo;do the reviews.&rdquo; I have the best of reasons for knowing that he
      fancied &ldquo;doing the reviews&rdquo; meant going into the park upon military
      field-days, and reporting thereupon.
    </p>
    <p>
      In short, the newspaper <i>staff</i> was an Irish blackthorn.
    </p>
    <p>
      It began to &ldquo;behave as sich.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The office was situated down a court on my line of route homeward; and one
      morning about three o&rsquo;clock I was passing the entrance to the court when I
      fancied I heard the sound of singing. I paused, and then, out of sheer
      curiosity, moved in the direction of the newspaper premises. By the time I
      had reached them the singing had broadened into recrimination. I have
      noticed that singing is usually the first step in that direction. The
      members of the literary staff had apparently assembled in the reporters&rsquo; 
      room, and, stealing past the flaring gas jet on the very rickety stairs, I
      reached that window of the apartment which looked upon the lobby. When I
      rubbed as much dust and grime off one of the panes as admitted of my
      seeing into the room, I learned more about fighting in five minutes than I
      had done during a South African campaign.
    </p>
    <p>
      A dozen or so bottles of various breeds lay about the floor, and a variety
      of drinking vessels lay about the long table at the moment of my glancing
      through the window. Only for a moment, however, for in another second the
      editor had leapt upon the table, and with one dexterous kick&mdash;a kick
      that no amount of Association play could cause one to acquire; a kick that
      must have been handed down, so to speak, from father to son, unto the
      third and fourth generations of backs&mdash;had sent every drinking vessel
      into the air. One&mdash;it was a jug&mdash;struck the ceiling, and brought
      down a piece of plaster about the size of a cart-wheel; but before the
      mist that followed this transaction had risen to obscure everything, I saw
      that a tumbler had shot out through the window that looked upon the court.
      I heard the crash below a moment afterwards. A mug had caught the
      corresponding portion of the anatomy of the gentleman from Waterford, and
      it irritated him; a cup crashed at the open mouth of the reviewer from
      Kilkenny, and, so far as I could see, he swallowed it; a tin pannikin
      carried away a portion of the ear of the musical critic from Tipperary&mdash;it
      was so large that he could easily spare a chip or so of it, though some
      sort of an ear is essential to the conscientious discharge of the duties
      of musical critic.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some time after, I could not see very distinctly what was going on in
      the room, for the dust from the dislodged plaster began to rise, and
      &ldquo;friend and foe were shadows in the mist.&rdquo; Now and again I caught a
      glimpse of the red-head of the Master of Arts and Gold Medallist
      permeating the mist, as the western sun permeates the smoke that hangs
      over a battle-field; and wherever that beacon-fire appeared devastation
      was wrought. The subeditor had gone down before him&mdash;so much I could
      see; and then all was dimness and yells again&mdash;yells that brought
      down more of the plaster and a portion of the stucco cornice; yells that
      chipped flakes off the marble mantelpiece and sent them quivering through
      the room; yells that you might have driven tenpenny nails home with.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the dust-cloud drifted away, and I was able to form a pretty good
      idea of what was going on. The meeting in mid-air of the ten-light
      gasalier, which the dramatic critic had pulled down, and the iron fender,
      which the chief of the reporting staff had picked up when he saw that his
      safety was imperilled, was epic. The legs of chairs and stools flying
      through the air suggested a blackboard illustration of a shower of
      meteors; every now and again one crashed upon a head and cannoned off
      against the wall, where it sometimes lodged and became a bracket that you
      might have hung a coat on, or else knocked a brick into the adjoining
      apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The room began to assume an untidy appearance after a while; but I noticed
      that the editor was making praiseworthy efforts to speak. I sympathised
      with the difficulty he seemed to have in that direction. It was not until
      he had folded in two the musical critic and the chief reporter, and had
      seated himself upon them without straightening them out, that his voice
      was heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Boys,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;if this work goes on much longer I fear there&rsquo;ll be a
      breach of the peace. Anyhow, I&rsquo;m thirsty. I&rsquo;ve a dozen of porter in my
      room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The only serious accident of the evening occurred at this point. The
      reviewer got badly hurt through being jammed in with the other six in the
      door leading to the editor&rsquo;s room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning the paper came out as usual, and the fact that the
      leaders were those that had appeared on the previous day, and that the
      Parliamentary report had been omitted, was not noticed. I met the
      red-haired editor as he came out of a chemist&rsquo;s shop that afternoon. I
      asked, as delicately as possible, after his health.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d be well enough if it wasn&rsquo;t for the sense of responsibility that
      sometimes oppresses me,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a terrible weight on a single
      man&rsquo;s shoulders that a daily paper is, so it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Do you feel it on your shoulders now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t I just?&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been buying some emulsion inside to see if
      that will give me any ease.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He then told me a painfully circumstantial story of how, when walking home
      early in the morning, he was set upon by some desperate miscreant, who had
      struck him twice upon his left eye, which might account, he said, for any
      slight discolouration I might notice in the region of that particular
      organ if I looked closely at it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what&rsquo;s the matter with your hair?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I inquired. &ldquo;It looks as if it had been powdered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blast it!&rdquo; said he, taking off his hat, and disclosing several hillocks
      of red heather with a patch of white sticking-plaster on their summits&mdash;like
      the illustration of the snow line on a geological model of the earth&rsquo;s
      surface. &ldquo;Blast it! It must have been the ceiling. It&rsquo;s a dog&rsquo;s life an
      editor&rsquo;s is, anyhow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I never saw him again.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, the foregoing narrative is only illustrative of the exuberance
      of the Irish nature under depressing circumstances; but I have also come
      in contact with sub-editors who were constitutionally quarrelsome. They
      were nearly as disagreeable to work with as those who were perpetually
      standing on their dignity&mdash;men who were never without a complaint of
      being insulted. I bore with one of this latter class longer than any one
      else would have done. He was the most incompetent man whom I ever met, so
      that one night when he growled out that he had never been so badly treated
      by his inferiors as he was just at that instant, I had no compunction in
      saying,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By whom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By my inferiors in this office,&rdquo; he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to know where your inferiors are,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re not in this
      office&mdash;so much I can swear. I doubt if they are in any other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He asked me if I meant to insult him, and I assured him that I invariably
      made my meaning so plain when I had occasion to say anything, there was no
      excuse for asking what I meant.
    </p>
    <p>
      He never talked to me again about being insulted.
    </p>

      Another curious specimen of an extinct animal was subject to remarkable
      fits of depression and moroseness. He offered to make me a bet one night
      that he would not be alive on that day week. I took him up promptly, and
      offered to stake a five-pound note on the issue, provided that he did the
      same. He said he hadn&rsquo;t a five-pound note in the world, though he had been
      toiling like a galley slave for twenty years. I pitied the poor fellow,
      though it was not until I saw his wife&mdash;a mass of black beads and
      pomatum&mdash;that I recognised his right to the consolation of pessimism.
      I believe that he was only deterred from suicide by an irresistible belief
      in a future state. He had heard a well-meant but injudicious sermon in
      which the statement was made that husband and wife, though parted by
      death, would one day be reunited. Believing this he lived on. What was the
      use of doing anything else?
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      I met with another sub-editor on whom for a period I looked with some
      measure of awe, being <i>in statu pupillari</i> at the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every night he used to take a razor out of his press and lay it beside his
      desk, having opened it with great deliberation and a hard look upon his
      haggard face. I believed that he was possessed of strong suicidal
      impulses, and that he was placing the razor where it would be handy in
      case he should find it necessary to make away with himself some night or
      in the early hours of the morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      I held him in respect for just one month. At the end of that time I saw
      him sharpening his pencil with the razor, and I ventured to inquire if he
      usually employed the instrument for that purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I lost six penknives in this room within a fortnight;
      those blue-pencilled reporters use up a lot of knives, and they never buy
      any, so I brought down this old razor. They&rsquo;ll not steal that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And they didn&rsquo;t.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I lost all respect for that sub-editor.

    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>NCE I saw a
      sub-editor actually within easy reach of suicide. It was not the
      duplicating of a five-column speech in flimsy, nor was it that the foreman
      printer had broken his heart. It was that he had been the victim of a
      heartless theft. His savings of years had been carried off in the course
      of a single night. So he explained to me with &ldquo;tears in his eyes,
      distraction in&rsquo;s aspect,&rdquo; when I came down to the office one evening. He
      was walking up and down his room, with three hours&rsquo; arrears of unopened
      telegrams on his desk and a <i>p.p.c.</i> note from the foreman beneath a
      leaden &ldquo;rule,&rdquo; used as a paper weight; for the foreman, being, as usual, a
      conscientious man, invariably promised to hand in his notice at sundown if
      kept waiting for copy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What on earth is the matter?&rdquo; I inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it neuralgia or&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s worse&mdash;worse!&rdquo; he moaned. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve lost all my money&mdash;all&mdash;all!
      there&rsquo;s the tin I kept it in&mdash;see for yourself if there&rsquo;s a penny
      left in it.&rdquo; He threw himself into his chair and bowed down his head upon
      his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Far off a solitary (speaking) trumpet blew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the hands are to go home you&rsquo;ve only got to say so and I release
      them,&rdquo; was the message that was delivered into my ear when I went to the
      end of the tube communicating with the foreman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three columns will be out inside half an hour,&rdquo; I replied. Then I turned
      to the sobbing sub-editor. &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;bear it like a man. It&rsquo;s a
      terrible thing, of course, but still it must be faced. Tell me how many
      pounds you&rsquo;ve lost, and I&rsquo;ll put the matter into the hands of the police.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked up with a vacant white face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How many&mdash;there were a hundred and forty pence in the tin when I
      went home last night. See if there&rsquo;s a penny left.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A cursory glance at the chocolate tin that lay on the table was quite
      sufficient to convince me that it was empty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cheer up,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;A hundred and forty pence. It sounds large in pence,
      to be sure, but when you think of it from the standard of the silver
      currency it doesn&rsquo;t seem so formidable. Eleven and eightpence. Of course
      it&rsquo;s a shocking thing. Was it all in pence?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All&mdash;all&mdash;every penny of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep up your heart. We may be able to trace the money. I suppose you are
      prepared to identify the coins?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He ran his fingers through his hair, and I could see that he was striving
      manfully to collect his thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Identify? I could swear to them if I saw them in the lump&mdash;one
      hundred and forty&mdash;one&mdash;hundred&mdash;and&mdash;forty&mdash;pence!
      Yes, I&rsquo;ll swear that I could swear to them in the lump. But singly&mdash;oh,
      I&rsquo;ll never see them again!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me how it came about that you had so much money in this room,&rdquo; said
      I, beginning to open the telegrams. &ldquo;Man, did you not think of the
      terrible temptation that you were placing in the way of the less opulent
      members of the staff? Eleven and eight in a disused chocolate tin! It&rsquo;s a
      temptation like this that turns honest men into thieves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then it was that he informed me on the point upon which I confess I was
      curious&mdash;namely, how he came to have this fortune in copper.
    </p>
    <p>
      His wife, he said, was in the habit of giving him a penny every rainy
      night, this being his tramcar fare from his house to his office. But&mdash;he
      emphasised this detail&mdash;she was usually weak enough not to watch to
      see whether he got into the tramcar or not, and the consequence was that,
      unless the night was very wet indeed, he was accustomed to walk the whole
      way and thus save the penny, which he nightly deposited in the chocolate
      tin: he could not carry it home with him, he said, for his wife would be
      certain to find it when she searched his waistcoat pockets before he arose
      in the morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For a hundred and forty times you persevered in this course of duplicity
      for the sake of the temporary gain!&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;It is this craving to become
      quickly rich that is the curse of the nineteenth century. I thought that
      journalists were free from it; I find that they are as bad as Stock
      Exchange gamblers or magazine proprietors. Oh, gold! gold! Go on with your
      work or there&rsquo;ll be a blue-pencilled row to-morrow. Don&rsquo;t fancy you&rsquo;ll
      obtain the sympathy of any human being in your well-earned misfortune. You
      don&rsquo;t deserve to have so good a wife. A penny every rainy night&mdash;a
      penny! Oh, I lose all patience when I think of your complaining. Go on
      with your work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went on with his work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some months after this incident he thought it necessary to tell me that he
      was a Scotchman.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not necessary; but I asked him if his wife was one too.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not exactly,&rdquo; said he argumentatively. &ldquo;But she&rsquo;s a native of Scotland&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
      say that much for her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I afterwards heard that he had become the proprietor of that very journal
      upon which he had been sub-editor.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was not surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      My memories of the sub-editor&rsquo;s room include a three months&rsquo; experience of
      a remarkable man. He imposed upon me for nearly a week, telling me
      anecdotes of the distinguished persons whom he had met in the course of
      his career. It seemed to me&mdash;for a week&mdash;that he was the darling
      of the most exclusive society in Europe. He talked about noble lords by
      their Christian names, and of noble ladies with equal breezy freedom. Many
      of his anecdotes necessitated a verbatim report of the replies made by
      marquises and countesses to his playful sallies; and I noticed that, so
      far as his recollection served him, they had always addressed him as
      George; sometimes&mdash;but only in the case of over-familiar daughters of
      peers&mdash;Georgie. I felt&mdash;for a week&mdash;that journalism had
      made a sensible advance socially when such things were possible. Perhaps,
      I thought, some day the daughter of a peer may distort my name, so that I
      may not die undistinguished.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have seen a good many padded peeresses and dowdy duchesses since those
      days, and my ambition has somehow drifted into other channels; but while
      the man talked of his intimacies with peers, and his friendship&mdash;he
      assured me on his sacred word of honour (whatever that meant) that it was
      perfectly Platonic&mdash;with peeresses.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was carried away&mdash;for a week.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was an undersized man, with a rooted prejudice against soap and the
      comb. He spoke like a common man, and wore clothes that were clearly
      second-hand. He posed as the rough diamond, the untamed literary lion, the
      genius who refuses to be trammelled by the usages&mdash;most of them
      purely artificial&mdash;of society, and on whom society consequently
      dotes.
    </p>
    <p>
      What he doted on was Dublin stout. If he had acquired during his
      intercourse with the aristocracy their effete taste in the way of
      drinking, he certainly managed to chasten it. He drank six bottles of
      stout in the course of a single night, and regretted that there was not a
      seventh handy.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a month he did his work moderately well, but at the end of that time
      he began to put it upon other people. He made excuse after excuse to shirk
      his legitimate duties. One night he came down with a swollen face. He was
      suffering inexpressible agony from toothache, he said, and if he were to
      sit down to his desk he really would not guarantee that some shocking
      mistake would not occur. He would, he declared, be serving the best
      interests of the paper if he were to go home to his bed. He only waited to
      drink a bottle of stout before going.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few days after his return to work he entered the office enveloped in an
      odoriferous muffler, and speaking hoarsely. He had, he said, caught so
      severe a cold that the doctor was not going to allow him to leave his
      house; but so soon as he got his back turned, he had run down to tell us
      that it was impossible for him to do anything for a night or two. He
      wanted to bind us down in the most solemn way not to let the doctor know
      that he came out, and we promised to let no one know except the manager.
      This assurance somehow did not seem to satisfy him. But he drank a bottle
      of porter and went away.
    </p>
    <p>
      The very next week he came to me in confidence, telling me that he had
      just received the proofs of his usual political article in the <i>Quarterly</i>,
      and that the editor had taken the trouble to telegraph to him to return
      the proofs for press without fail the next day. Now, the only question
      with him was, should he chuck up the <i>Quarterly</i>, for which he had
      written for many years, or the humble daily paper in the office of which
      he was standing.
    </p>
    <p>
      I did not venture to suggest a solution of the problem.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe you wouldn&rsquo;t mind taking a squint&rdquo;&mdash;his phraseology was that
      of the rough genius&mdash;&ldquo;through the telegrams for to-night,&rdquo; said he.
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like to impose on a good-natured sonny like you, but you see how
      I&rsquo;m situated. Confound that <i>Quarterly!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you do the political article for the <i>Quarterly?</i>&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Man, I&rsquo;ve done it for the past eleven years,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I thought every
      one knew that. It&rsquo;s editor of the <i>Quarterly</i> that I should be to-day
      if William Smith hadn&rsquo;t cut me out of the job. But I bear him no malice&mdash;bless
      your soul, not I. You&rsquo;ll go over the flimsies?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I said I would, and he wiped a bath sponge of porter-froth off his beard
      in order to thank me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I knew that he was telling me a lie about the <i>Quarterly</i>, but I did
      his work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Less than a week after, he entered my room to express the hope that I
      would be able to make arrangements to have his work done for him once
      again, the fact being that he had just received a message from Mrs.
      Thompson&mdash;the wife of young Thompson, the manager for Messrs. Gibson,
      the shippers&mdash;to ask him for heaven&rsquo;s sake to help her to look after
      her husband that night. Young Thompson had been behaving rather wildly of
      late, it appeared, and was suffering from an attack of that form of
      heredity known as <i>delirium tremens</i>. He had been held down in the
      bed by three men and Mrs. Thompson the previous night, my informant said,
      and added that he himself would probably be one of a fresh batch on whom a
      similar duty would devolve inside an hour or so.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had scarcely left the office&mdash;after refreshing himself by the
      artificial aid of Guinness&mdash;before a knock came to my door, and the
      next moment Mr. Thompson himself quietly entered. I saw that the poker was
      within easy reach, and then asked him how he was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m all right,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I merely dropped in to borrow the <i>Glasgow
      Herald</i> for a few minutes. I heard to-day that a ship of ours was
      reported as spoken, but I can&rsquo;t find it in any paper that has come to us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can have the <i>Herald</i> with pleasure,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t go to
      the concert last night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;You see it was the night of our choir practice, and I had
      to attend it to keep the others up to their work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The next night I asked the sub-editor how his friend Mr. Thompson was, and
      if he had experienced much difficulty in keeping him from making an
      onslaught upon the snakes.
    </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head solemnly, as if his experiences of the previous night
      were too terrible to be expressed in ordinary colloquialisms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sonny,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;pray that you may never see all that I saw last night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or all that Thompson saw,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Was he very bad?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As bad as they make them,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I sat on his head for hours at a
      stretch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When he was off his head you were on it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay; but every now and again he would, by an almost superhuman effort,
      toss me half way up to the ceiling. Man, it was an awful night! It&rsquo;s
      heartless of me not being with the poor woman now; but I said I&rsquo;d do a
      couple of hours&rsquo; work before going.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Maybe Thompson will call here and you can walk up
      with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thompson call? What the blue pencil do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just what I say. If you had waited for five minutes last night you might
      have had his company up to that pleasant little <i>séance</i> in which you
      turned his head into a chair. He called to see the <i>Glasgow Herald</i>
      before you could have reached the end of the street.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He gave a little gasp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say Thompson, did I?&rdquo; he asked, after a pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You certainly did,&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be forgetting my own name next,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;The man&rsquo;s name is
      Johnston&mdash;he lives in the corner house of the row I lodge in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anyhow, you&rsquo;ll not see him to-night,&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The fellow failed to exasperate me even then. But he succeeded early the
      next month. He came to me one night with a magazine in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder if the boss&rdquo;&mdash;I think I mentioned that he was a rough
      diamond&mdash;&ldquo;would mind my inserting a column or so of extracts from
      this paper of mine in the <i>Drawing Room</i> on Benvenuto Cellini?&rdquo; He
      pronounced the name &ldquo;Selliny.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On whom is the paper?&rdquo; I inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Selliny&mdash;Benvenuto Selliny. I&rsquo;ve made Selliny my own&mdash;no man
      living can touch me there. I knocked off the thing in a hurry, but it
      reads very well, though I say it who shouldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t you say it?&rdquo; I inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well when you&rsquo;ve written as much as me,&rdquo;&mdash;he was a rough diamond&mdash;&ldquo;maybe
      you&rsquo;ll be as modest,&rdquo; he cried, gaily. &ldquo;When you can knock off a paper&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s one paper that you&rsquo;ll not knock off, but that you&rsquo;ll be pretty
      soon knocked off,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;and that paper is the one that you are
      connected with just now. If lies were landed property you&rsquo;d be one of the
      largest holders of real estate in the world. I never met such a liar as
      you are. You never wrote that article on Benvenuto Cellini&mdash;you don&rsquo;t
      even know how to pronounce the man&rsquo;s name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The boy&rsquo;s mad&mdash;mad!&rdquo; he cried, with a laugh that was not a laugh.
      &ldquo;Mr. Barton,&rdquo;&mdash;the managing editor had entered the room,&mdash;&ldquo;this
      fair-haired young gentleman is a bit off his head, I&rsquo;m thinking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not off my head in the least,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Do you mean to say, in the
      presence of Mr. Barton, that you wrote that paper in the <i>Drawing Room</i>
      on Benvenuto Cellini?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you want me to take my oath that I wrote it?&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;What makes you
      think that I didn&rsquo;t write it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing beyond the fact that I wrote it myself, and that this slip of
      paper which I hold in my hand is the cheque that was sent to me in payment
      for it, and that this other slip is the usual form of acknowledgment&mdash;you
      see the title of the article on the side&mdash;which I have to post
      to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a silence in the room. The managing editor had seated himself in
      my chair and was scribbling something at the desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My fair-haired friend,&rdquo; said the sub-editor, &ldquo;I thought that you would
      have seen from the first the joke I was playing on you. Why, man, the
      instant I read the paper I knew it was by you. Don&rsquo;t you fancy that I know
      your fluent style by this time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fancy that there&rsquo;s no greater liar on earth than yourself,&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; he cried, assuming a menacing attitude. &ldquo;I can stand a lot,
      but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so can I,&rdquo; said the managing editor, &ldquo;but at last the breaking strain
      is reached. That paper will allow of your drawing a month&rsquo;s salary
      to-morrow,&rdquo;&mdash;he handed him the paper which he had scribbled,&mdash;&ldquo;and
      I think that as this office has done without you for eleven nights during
      the past month, it will do without you for the twelfth. Don&rsquo;t let me find
      you below when I am going away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He didn&rsquo;t.

      I cannot say that I ever met another man connected with a newspaper quite
      so unscrupulous as the man with whom I have just dealt. I can certainly
      safely say that I never again knew of a journalist laying claim to the
      authorship of anything that I wrote, either in a daily paper, where
      everything is anonymous, or in a magazine, where I employed a pseudonym.
      No one thought it worth his while doing so. A man who was not a
      journalist, however, took to himself the honour and glory associated with
      the writing of a leaderette of mine on the excellent management of a local
      library. The man who was idiot enough to do so was a theological student
      in the Presbyterian interest. He began to frequent the library without
      previously having paid his fare, and on being remonstrated with mildly by
      the young librarian, said that surely it was not a great concession on the
      part of the committee to allow him the run of the building after the
      article he had written in the leading newspaper on the manner in which the
      institution was conducted. It so happened, however, that the librarian
      had, at my request, furnished me with the statistics that formed the basis
      of the leaderette, and he had no hesitation in saying of the divinity
      student at his leisure what David said of all men in his haste. But after
      being thrust out of the library and called an impostor, the divinity
      student went home and wrote a letter signed &ldquo;Theologia,&rdquo; in which he made
      a furious onslaught upon the management of the library, and had the
      effrontery to demand its insertion in the newspaper the next day.
    </p>
    <p>
      He is now a popular and deservedly respected clergyman, and I hear that
      his sermon on Acts v., 1-11 is about to be issued in pamphlet form.

      Curiously enough quite recently a man in whose chambers I was
      breakfasting, pointed out to me what he called a good story that had
      appeared in a paper on the previous evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      The paragraph in which it was included was as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A rather amusing story is told by the <i>Avilion Gazettes</i> Special
      Commissioner in his latest article on &lsquo;Ireland as it is and as it would
      be.&rsquo; It is to the effect that some of the Irish members recently wished to
      cross the Channel for half-a-crown each, and to that end called on a boat
      agent, a Tory, who knew them, when the following conversation took place:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Can we go across for half-a-crown each?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;No, ye can&rsquo;t, thin.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;An&rsquo; why not?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Because&rsquo;tis a cattle boat.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Nevermind that, sure we&rsquo;re not particular.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;No, but the cattle are.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That was the entire paragraph..
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a bit rough on your compatriots,&rdquo; said my host. &ldquo;You look as if you
      feel it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;I feel it to be rather sad that a story that a fellow
      takes the trouble to invent and to print in a pamphlet, should be picked
      up by an English correspondent in Dublin, printed in one of his letters
      from Ireland, and afterwards published in a London evening paper without
      any acknowledgment being made of the source whence it was derived.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And that is my opinion still. The story was a pure invention of my own,
      and it was printed in an anonymous skit, only without the brogue. It was
      left for the English Special Commissioner to make a feature of the brogue,
      of which, of course, he had become a master, having been close upon two
      days in Dublin.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the most amusing thing to me was to find that the sub-editor of the
      newspaper with which I was connected had actually cut the paragraph out of
      the London paper and inserted it in our columns. He pointed it out to me
      on my return, and asked me if I didn&rsquo;t think it a good story.
    </p>
    <p>
      I said it was first rate, and inquired if he had ever heard the story
      before. He replied that he never had.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was, I repeat, the point of the whole incident which amused me most;
      for I had made the sub-editor a present of the original pamphlet, and he
      said he had enjoyed it immensely.
    </p>
    <p>
      He also hopes to be one day an ordained clergyman.

    <p>
      When in Ireland during the General Election of 1892, I got a telegram one
      night informing me that Mr. Justin M&rsquo;Carthy had been defeated in Derry
      that day by Mr. Ross, Q.C.
    </p>
    <p>
      It occurred to me that if a quatrain could be made upon the incident it
      might be read the next day. The following was the result of the great
      mental effort necessary to bring to bear upon the task:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;That the Unionists Derry can win
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Is a matter to-day beyond doubt;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      For Ross the Q.C. is just in,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      And the one that&rsquo;s Justin is just out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      I put my initials to this masterpiece, and I need scarcely say that I was
      dizzy with pride when it appeared at the head of a column the next
      morning. Now, that thing kept staring me in the face out of every
      newspaper, English as well as Irish, that I picked up during the next
      fortnight, only it appeared without my initials, but in compensation bore
      as preface, lest the reader might be amazed at coming too suddenly upon
      such subtle humour, these words:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The following epigram by a Dublin wit is being widely circulated in the
      Irish metropolis.&rdquo; Some months afterwards, when I chanced to pay a visit
      to Dublin, the author of the epigram was pointed out to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So it was he who wrote that thing about just in and just out?&rdquo; I
      remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was,&rdquo; said my friend. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d introduce you to him only, between
      ourselves, though a nice enough fellow before he wrote that, <i>he hasn&rsquo;t
      been very approachable since</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I felt extremely obliged to the gentleman. I thought of Mary Barton, the
      heroic lady represented by Miss Bateman long ago, who had accused herself
      of the crime committed by another.

      In the preparation of stories for the Press it is, I feel more impressed
      every day, absolutely necessary to bear in mind the authentic case of the
      young sailor&rsquo;s mother who abused him for telling her so palpably
      impossible a yarn about his having seen fish rise from the water and fly
      along like birds, but who was quite ready to accept his account of the
      crimson expanse of the Red Sea. Some of the most interesting incidents
      that have actually come under my notice could not possibly be published if
      accuracy were strictly observed as to the details. They are &ldquo;owre true&rdquo; to

      dishonest livelihood, represented himself at a newspaper office as a
      journalist, and only asked for a trial job. The editor, believing he saw
      an excellent way of getting rid of a parcel of books that had come for
      review, flung him the lot and told him to write three-quarters of a column
      of flare-up head-lines, and a quarter of reviews, and maybe some fool
      might be attracted to the book column. Now, at the top of the batch there
      chanced to be the first instalment of a new Polyglot Bible, after the plan
      so successfully adopted by Messrs. Bagster, about to be issued in parts,
      and the reviewer failed to recognise the Book of Genesis, which he
      accordingly read for fetching head-lines. The result of his labours by
      some oversight appeared in the next issue of the paper, and attracted a
      considerable amount of interest in religious circles in Boston.

      The remaining quarter of a column was occupied by a circumstantial and
      highly colloquial account of the incidents recorded in the Book of
      Genesis, and it very plainly suggested that the work had been published by
      Messrs. Hoskins as a satire upon the success of the Hebrew race in the New
      England States. The reviewer even made an attempt to identify Joseph with
      a prominent Republican politician, and Potiphar&rsquo;s wife with the Democratic
      party, who were alleged to be making overtures to the same gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I really did once meet with a sub-editor who had reviewed &ldquo;The Swiss
      Family Robinson&rdquo; as a new work. He commenced by telling the readers of the
      newspaper that the book was a wholesome story of a worthy Swiss pastor,
      and so forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also knew a musical critic who, on being entrusted with the duty of
      writing a notice of <i>Il Don Giovanni</i>, as performed by the Carl Rosa
      Company, began as follows: &ldquo;Don Giovanni, the gentleman from whom the
      opera takes its name, was a licentious Spanish nobleman of the past
      century.&rdquo; The notice gave some account of the <i>affaires</i> of this
      newly-discovered reprobate, glossing over the Zerlina business rather more
      than Mozart thought necessary to do, but being very bitter against
      Leporello, &ldquo;his valet and confidant,&rdquo; and finally expressing the opinion
      somewhat dogmatically that &ldquo;few of the public would be disposed to say
      that the fate which overtook this callous scoundrel was not well earned by
      his persistence in a course of unjustifiable vice. The music is tuneful
      and was much encored.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Upon the occasion of this particular representation I recollect that I
      wrote, &ldquo;An Italian version of a Spanish story, set to music by a German,
      conducted by a Frenchman, and interpreted by a Belgian, a Swiss, an
      Irishman and a Canadian&mdash;this is what is meant by English Opera.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My notice gave great offence; but the other was considered excellent.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moral tone that pervaded it was most praiseworthy, the people said.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so it was.

    <p>
      I have got about five hundred musical jottings which, if provoked, I may
      one day publish; but, meantime, I cannot refrain from giving one
      illustration of the way in which musical notices were managed long ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Adelina Patti had made her first (and farewell) appearance in the
      town where I was located. I was engaged about two o&rsquo;clock in the morning
      putting what I considered to be the finishing touches to the column which
      I had written about the diva&rsquo;s concert, when the reporter of the leading
      paper burst into the room in which I was writing. He was in rather a
      dishevelled condition, and he approached me and whispered that he wanted
      to ask me a question outside&mdash;there were others in the room. I went
      through the door with him and inquired what I could do for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was marked for that blessed concert, and I went too, and now I&rsquo;m
      writing the notice,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;But what I want to know is this&mdash;<i>Is
      Patti a soprano or a contralto?</i>&rdquo;

    <p>
      I have just now discovered that it would be unwise for me to continue very
      much farther these reminiscences of editors and sub-editors, the fact
      being that I have some jottings about every one of the race whom I have
      ever met, and when one gets into a desultory vein of anecdotage like that
      in which I now find myself for the first time in my life, one is liable to
      exhaust a reader&rsquo;s forbearance before one&rsquo;s legitimate subject has become
      exhausted. I think it may be prudent to make a diversion at this period
      from the sub-editors of the past to the suppers of the newspaper office.
      Gastronomy as a science is not drawn out to its finest point within these
      precincts. There is still something left to be desired by such persons as
      are fastidious. I have for long thought that it would be by no means
      extravagant to expect every newspaper office to be supplied with a
      kitchen, properly furnished, and with the &ldquo;good plain cook,&rdquo; who so
      constantly figures in the columns (advertising), at hand to turn out the
      suppers for all departments engaged in the production of the paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is inconvenient for an editor to be compelled to cook his own supper at
      his gas stove, while the flimsies of the speech upon which he is writing
      are being laid on his desk by the sub-editor, and the foreman&rsquo;s messenger
      is asking for them almost before they have ceased to flutter in the
      cooling draught created by opening the door. Equally inconvenient is it
      for the sub-editor and the reporters to get something to prevent them from
      succumbing to starvation. The compositors in some offices have lately
      instituted a rule by which they &ldquo;knock off&rdquo; for supper at half-past ten;
      but what sort of a meal do they get to sustain them until four in the
      morning? I have no hesitation in pronouncing it to be almost as
      indifferent as that upon which the editor is forced to subsist for,
      perhaps, the same period. I have seen the compositors&mdash;some of them
      earning £5 a week&mdash;crouching under their cases, munching hunches (the
      onomatopæia is Homeric) of bread, while their cans of tea&mdash;that
      abomination of cold tea warmed up&mdash;were stewing over their gas
      burners.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the sub-editors&rsquo; room, and the reporters&rsquo; room, tea was also being
      cooked, or bottles of stout drunk, the accompanying, comestibles being
      bread or biscuits. After swallowing tea that has been stewing on its
      leaves for half-an-hour, and eating a slab of office bread out of one hand
      while the other holds the pen, the editor writes an article on the
      grievances of shopmen who are only allowed an hour for dinner and
      half-an-hour for tea; or, upon the slavery of a barmaid; or, perhaps,
      composes a nice chatty half-column on the progress of dyspepsia and the
      necessity for attending carefully to one&rsquo;s diet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, I affirm that no newspaper office should be without a kitchen. The
      compositors should be given a chance of obtaining all the comforts of home
      at a lesser cost than they could be provided at home; and later on in the
      night the reporters, sub-editors, and editor should be able to send up
      messages as to the hour they mean to take supper, and the dish which they
      would like to have. Here is an opportunity for the Institute of
      Journalists. Let them take sweet counsel together on the great kitchen
      question, and pass a resolution &ldquo;that in the opinion of the Institute a
      kitchen in complete working order should form part of every morning
      newspaper office; and that a cook, holding a certificate from South
      Kensington, or, better still, Mrs. Marshall, should be regarded as
      essential to the working staff as the editor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I do not say that a box of Partagas, or Carolinas, should be provided by
      the management for every room occupied by the literary staff; though
      undoubtedly a move in the right direction, yet I fear that public feeling
      has not yet been sufficiently aroused by the bitter cry of the journalist,
      to make the cigar-box and the club chair probable; but I do say that since
      journalism has become a profession, those who practise it should be
      treated as if they were as deserving of consideration as the salesmen in
      drapers&rsquo; shops. Surely, as we have sent the bitter cry into all the ends
      of the earth on behalf of others, we might be permitted the luxury of a
      little bitter cry on our own account.

    <p>
      This brings me down to the recollections I retain of the strange ideas
      that some of the staff of journals with which I have been connected,
      possessed as to the most appropriate menu for supper. One of these
      gentlemen, for instance, was accustomed to make oatmeal porridge in a
      saucepan for himself about two o&rsquo;clock in the morning. When accused of
      being a Scotchman, he indignantly denied that he was one. He admitted,
      however, that he was an Ulsterman, and this was considered even worse by
      his accusers. He invariably alluded to the porridge in the plural, calling
      it &ldquo;them.&rdquo; I asked him one night why the thing was entitled to a plural,
      and he said it was because no one but a blue-pencilled fool would allude
      to it as otherwise. I had the curiosity to inquire farther how much
      porridge was necessary to be in the saucepan before it became entitled to
      a plural; if, for instance, there was only a spoonful, surely it would be
      rather absurd to still speak of it as &ldquo;them.&rdquo; He replied, after some
      thought, that though he had never considered the matter in all its
      bearings, yet his impression was that even a spoonful was entitled to a
      plural.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you ever hear any one allude to brose as &lsquo;it&rsquo;?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      I admitted that I never had.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then if you call brose &lsquo;them,&rsquo; why shouldn&rsquo;t you call stirabout &lsquo;them&rsquo;?&rdquo;
       he asked, triumphantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must confess that I never had the matter brought so forcibly before
      me,&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he was going to &ldquo;sup them,&rdquo; as he termed the operation of ladling the
      contents of the saucepan into his mouth, I hastily left the room. I have
      eaten tiffin within easy reach of a dozen lepers on Robben Island in Table
      Bay, I have taken a hearty supper in a tent through which a camel every
      now and again thrust its nose, I have enjoyed a biltong sandwich on the
      seat of an African bullock waggon with a Kaffir beside me, I have even
      eaten a sausage snatched by the proprietor from the seething panful in the
      window of a shop in the Euston Road&mdash;I did so to celebrate the
      success of a play of mine at the Grand Theatre&mdash;but I could not
      remain in the room while that literary gentleman partook of that simple
      supper of his.
    </p>
    <p>
      On my return when he had finished I never failed to allow in the most
      cordial way the right of the preparation to a plural. It was to be found
      in every part of the room; the table, the chairs, the floor, the
      fireplace, the walls, the ceiling&mdash;all bore token to the fact that it
      was not one but many.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the hands of a true Ulsterman stirabout &ldquo;are&rdquo; a terrible weapon.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a mural decorative medium &ldquo;they&rdquo; leave much to be desired.

      Only one man connected with the Press did
    </p>
    <p>
      I ever know addicted to the bloater as a supper dish. The man came among
      us like a shadow and disappeared as such, after a week of incompetence;
      but he left a memory behind him that not all the perfumes of Arabia can
      neutralise. It was about one o&rsquo;clock in the morning&mdash;he had come on
      duty that night&mdash;that there floated through the newspaper office a
      dense blue smoke and a smell&mdash;such a smell! It was of about the same
      density as an ironclad. One felt oneself struggling through it as though
      it were a mass of chilled steel plates, backed with soft iron. On the
      upper floor we were built in by it, so to speak. It arose on every side of
      us like the wall of a prison, and we kept groping around it for a hole
      large enough to allow of our crawling through. Two of us, after battering
      at that smell for a quarter of an hour, at last discovered a narrow
      passage in it made by a current of air from an open window, and having
      squeezed ourselves through, we ran downstairs to the sub-editors&rsquo; room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through the crawling blue smoke we could just make out the figure of a man
      standing in his shirt sleeves in front of the fire using a large
      two-pronged iron fork as a toothpick. On a plate on the table lay the
      dislocated backbone of a red herring (<i>harengus rufus</i>).
    </p>
    <p>
      The man was perfectly self-possessed. We questioned him closely about the
      origin of the smoke and the smell, and he replied that, without going so
      far as to pronounce a dogmatic opinion on the subject, and while he was
      quite ready to accept any reasonable suggestion on the matter from either
      of us, he, for his part, would not be at all surprised if it were found on
      investigation that both smoke and smell were due to his having openly
      cooked a rather bloated specimen of the Yarmouth bloater. He always had
      one for his supper, he said; critically, when not too pungent&mdash;he
      disliked them too pungent&mdash;he considered that a full-grown bloater,
      well preserved for its years and considering the knocking about that it
      must have had, was fully equal to a beefsteak. There was much more
      practical eating in it, he should say, speaking as man to man. And it was
      so very simple&mdash;that was its great charm.
    </p>
    <p>
      For himself, he never could bear made-up dishes; they were, he thought,
      usually rich, and he had a poor-enough digestion, so that he could not
      afford to trifle with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just then the foreman loomed through the dense smoke, and, being
      confronted with the hydra-headed smell, he boldly grappled with it, and
      after a fierce contest, he succeeded in strangling one of the heads and
      then set his foot on it. He hurriedly explained to the subeditor that all
      the hands who had lifted the copy that had been sent out were setting it
      up with bowls of water beside them to save themselves the trouble of going
      to the water-tap for a drink.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day the clerks in the mercantile department were working with
      bottles of carbolic under their noses, and every now and again a note
      would be brought in from a subscriber ordering his paper to be stopped
      until a new consignment of printers&rsquo; ink should arrive, in which the chief
      ingredient was not so pungent.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of a week the sub-editor was given a month&rsquo;s salary and an
      excellent testimonial, and was dismissed. The proprietor of the journal
      had the sub-editors&rsquo; room freshly painted and papered, and made the
      assistant-editor a present of two pounds to buy a new coat to replace the
      one which, having hung in the room for an entire night, had to be burnt,
      no cleaner being found who would accept the risk of purifying it. The
      cleaners all said that they would not run the chance of having all the
      contents of their vats left on their hands. They weren&rsquo;t as a rule
      squeamish in the matter of smells; they only drew the line at creosote,
      and the coat was a long way on the other side.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seven years have passed since that sub-editor partook of that simple
      supper, and yet I hear that every night drag-hounds howl at the door of
      the room, and strangers on entering sniff, saying,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whew! there&rsquo;s a barrel of red herrings somewhere about.&rdquo;

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>T might be as
      well, I fancy, to accept with caution the statement made in the last lines
      of the foregoing chapter. At any rate, I may frankly confess that I have
      always done so, knowing how apt one is to be carried away by one&rsquo;s
      imagination in some matters. Mr. Henry Irving told me several years ago a
      curious story on this very point, and in regard also to the way in which
      the imagination may be affected through the sense of smell.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he was very young he was living at a town in the west of England, and
      in one of the streets there was a hostelry which bore a swinging sign with
      a stag&rsquo;s head painted upon it, with a sufficient degree of legibility to
      enable casual passers-by to know what it was meant to simulate. But every
      time he saw this sign, he had a feeling of nausea that he could overcome
      only by hurrying on down the street. Mr. Irving explained to me that it
      did not appear to him that this nausea was the result of an offended
      artistic perception owing to any indifferent draughtsmanship or defective
      <i>technique</i> in the production of the sign. It actually seemed to him
      that the painted stag possesses some influence akin to the evil eye, and
      it was altogether very distressing to him. After a short time he left the
      town, and did not revisit it until he had attained maturity; and then,
      remembering the stag&rsquo;s head and the curious way in which it had affected
      him long before, he thought he would look up the old place, if it still
      existed, and try if the evil charm of the sign had ceased to retain its
      potency upon him. He walked down the street; there the sign was swinging
      as of old, and the moment he saw it he had a feeling of nausea. Now,
      however, he had become so impregnated with the investigating spirit of the
      time, that he determined to search out the origin of the malign influence
      of the neighbourhood; and then he discovered that the second house from
      the hostelry was a soap and candle factory, on a sufficiently extensive
      scale to make a daily &ldquo;boiling&rdquo; necessary. It was the odour arising from
      this enterprise that induced the disagreeable sensation which he had
      experienced years before, and from which few persons are free when in the
      neighbourhood of tallow in a molten state.
    </p>
    <p>
      I do not think that this story has been published. But even if it has
      appeared elsewhere it scarcely requires an apology.

      Though wandering even more widely than usual from my text&mdash;after all,
      my texts are only pretexts for unlimited ramblings&mdash;I will give
      another curious but perfectly authentic case of the force of imagination.
      In this case the imagination was reached through the sense of hearing.
    </p>
    <p>
      At one time I lived in a town at the extremity of a very fine bay, at the
      entrance to which there was a small village with a little bay of its own
      and a long stretch of sand, the joy of the &ldquo;tripper.&rdquo; I was a &ldquo;tripper&rdquo; of
      six in those days, and during the summer months an excursion by steamer on
      the bay was one of the most joyous of experiences. But the steamer was a
      very small one, and apt to yield rather more than is consistent with
      modern ideas of marine stability to the pressure of the waves, which in a
      north-easterly wind&mdash;the prevailing one&mdash;were pretty high in our
      bay. The effect of this instability was invariably disastrous to a maiden
      aunt who was supposed to share with me the enjoyment of being caught
      &ldquo;tripping.&rdquo; With the pertinacity of a man of six carrying a model of a
      cutter close to his bosom, I refused to &ldquo;go below&rdquo; under the
      circumstances, with my groaning but otherwise august relative, and she was
      usually extremely unwell. It so happened, however, that the proprietors of
      the steamboat were sufficiently enterprising to engage&mdash;perhaps I
      should say, to permit&mdash;a German band to drown the groans of the
      sufferers in the strains of the beautiful &ldquo;Blue Danube,&rdquo; or whatever the
      waltz of the period may have been&mdash;the &ldquo;Blue Danube&rdquo; is the oldest
      that I can remember. Now, when the &ldquo;season&rdquo; was over, and the steamer was
      laid up for the winter, the Germans were accustomed to give open-air
      performances in the town; so that during the winter months we usually had
      a repetition on land of the summer&rsquo;s <i>répertoire</i> at sea. The first
      bray that was given by the trombone in the region of the square where we
      lived was, however, quite enough to make my aunt give distinct evidence of
      feeling &ldquo;a little squeamish&rdquo;; by the time the oboe had joined hands, so to
      speak, with the parent of all evil, the trombone, she had taken out her
      handkerchief and was making wry faces beneath her palpably false scalpet.
      But when the wry-necked fife, and the serpent&mdash;the sea-serpent it was
      to her&mdash;were doing their worst in league with, but slightly
      indifferent to, the cornet and the Saxe-horn, my aunt retired from the
      apartment amid the derisive yells of the young demons in the schoolroom,
      and we saw her no more until the master of the music had pulled the bell
      of the hall-door, and we had insulted him in his own language by shouting
      through the blinds &ldquo;schlechte musik!&mdash;sehr schlechte musik!&rdquo; We were
      ready enough to learn a language for insulting purposes, just as a parrot
      which declines to acquire the few refined words of its mistress, will, if
      left within the hearing of a groom, repeat quite glibly and joyously,
      phrases which make it utterly useless as a drawing-room bird in a house
      where a clergyman makes an occasional call. For years my aunt could never
      hear a German band without emotion, since the crazy little steamer had
      danced to their strains. In this case, it must also be remarked, the
      feeling was not the result of a highly-developed artistic temperament. The
      blemishes of the musical performances were in no way accountable for my
      relative&rsquo;s emotions, though I believe that the average German band
      frequenting what theatrical-touring companies call &ldquo;B. towns,&rdquo; might
      reasonably be regarded as sufficient to precipitate an incipient disorder.
      No, it was the force of imagination that brought about my aunt&rsquo;s disaster,
      which, I regret to say, I occasionally purchased, when I felt that I owed
      myself a treat, for a penny, for this was the lowest sum that the <i>impresario</i>
      would take to come round our square and make my aunt sick. The sum was so
      absurdly low, considering the extent of the results produced, I am now
      aware that no really cultured musician, no <i>impresario</i> with any
      self-respect, would have accepted it to bring his band round the corner;
      but when one reflects that the sum on the original <i>scrittura</i> was
      invariably doubled&mdash;for my aunt sent a penny out when her sufferings
      became intense, to induce the band to go away&mdash;the transaction
      assumes another aspect.
    </p>
    <p>
      We hear of the enormous increase in the salaries paid to musical artists
      nowadays, and as an instance of this I may mention that a friend of mine a
      few months ago, having occasion for the services of a German band&mdash;not
      for medicinal purposes but for a philological reason&mdash;was forced to
      pay two shillings before he could effect his object! Truly the conditions
      under which art is pursued have undergone a marvellous change within a
      quarter of a century. I could have made my aunt sick twenty-four times for
      the sum demanded for a single performance nowadays. And in the sixties, it
      must also be remembered, Wagner had not become a power.

      Strong-minded persons, such as the first Lord Brougham, may take a
      sardonic delight in reading their own obituary notices, and such persons
      would probably scoff at the suggestion made in an earlier chapter, that
      the shock of reading the record of his death in a newspaper might have a
      disastrous effect upon a man, but there is surely no lack of evidence to
      prove the converse of &ldquo;<i>mentem mortalia tangunt</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I heard when in India a story which seemed to me to be, as an illustration
      of the effects of imagination, quite as curious as the well-known case of
      the sailor who became cured of scurvy through fancying that the clinical
      thermometer with which the surgeon took his temperature was a drastic
      remedy. A young civil servant at Colombo felt rather fagged after an
      unusually long stretch of work, and made up his mind to consult the best
      doctor in the place. He did so, and the doctor went through the usual
      probings and stethoscopings, and then looked grave and went over half the
      surface again. He said he thought that on the whole he had better write
      his opinion of the &ldquo;case&rdquo; in all its particulars and send it to the
      patient.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning the patient received the following letter:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Sir,&mdash;I think it only due to the confidence which you have
      placed in me to let you know in the plainest words what is the result of
      my diagnosis of your condition. Your left lung is almost gone, but with
      care you might survive its disappearance. Unhappily, however, the cardiac
      complications which I suspected are such as preclude the possibility of
      your recovery. In brief, I consider it to be my duty to advise you to lose
      no time in carrying out any business arrangements that demand your
      personal attention. You may of course live for some weeks; but I think you
      would do wisely to count only on days.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Meantime, I would suggest no material change in your diet, except the
      reduction of your brandy pegs to seven per diem.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This letter was put into the hands of the unfortunate man when he returned
      from his early ride the next morning. Its effect was to diminish to an
      appreciable degree his appetite for breakfast. He sat motionless on his
      chair out on the verandah and stared at the letter&mdash;it was his
      death-warrant. After an hour he felt a difficulty in breathing. He
      remembered now that he had always been uneasy about his lungs&mdash;his
      left in particular. He put his hand over the place where he supposed his
      heart to lie concealed. How could he have lived so many years in the world
      without becoming aware of the fact that as an every-day sort of an organ&mdash;leaving
      the higher emotions out of the question altogether&mdash;his heart was a
      miserable failure? Sympathy, friendship, love, emotion,&mdash;he would not
      have minded if his heart were incapable of these, if it only did its
      business as a blood pump; but it was perfectly plain from the manner in
      which it throbbed beneath his hand, that it was deserving of all the
      reprobation the doctor had heaped upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      His difficulty of respiration increased, and with this difficulty he
      became conscious of an acute pain under his ribs. He found when he
      attempted to rise that he could only do so with an effort. He managed to
      totter into his bedroom, and when he threw himself on his bed, it was with
      the feeling that he should never rise from it again.
    </p>
    <p>
      His faithful Khânsâmah more than once inquired respectfully if the
      Preserver of the Poor would like to have the Doctor Sahib sent for, and if
      the Joy of the Whole World would in the meantime drink a peg. But the
      Preserver of the Poor had barely strength to express the hope that the
      disappearance of the Doctor Sahib might be effected by a supernatural
      agency, and the Joy of the Whole World could only groan at the suggestion
      of a peg. The pain under his ribs was increasing, and he had a general
      nightmare feeling upon him. Toward evening he sank into a lethargy, and at
      this point the Khânsâmah made up his mind that the time for action had
      come; he went for the doctor himself, and was fortunate enough to meet him
      going out in his buggy to dine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What on earth have you been doing with yourself?&rdquo; he inquired, when he
      had felt the pulse of the patient. &ldquo;Why, you&rsquo;ve no pulse to speak of, and
      your skin&mdash;What the mischief have you been doing since yesterday?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can you expect a chap&rsquo;s pulse to be anything particular when he has
      no heart worth speaking of?&rdquo; gasped the patient.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who has no heart worth speaking of?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The patient looked piteously up at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s kicking a man when he&rsquo;s down,&rdquo; he murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with you anyway?&rdquo; said the doctor. &ldquo;Your heart&rsquo;s all
      right, I know&mdash;at least, it was all right yesterday. Is it your
      liver? Let me have a look at your eyes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He certainly did let the doctor have a look at his eyes. He lay staring at
      the good physician for some minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, your liver is no worse than it was yesterday,&rdquo; said the doctor,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean to say that your letter was only a joke?&rdquo; said the patient,
      still staring.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A joke? Don&rsquo;t be a fool. Do you fancy that I play jokes upon my patients?
      I wrote to you what was the exact truth. I flatter myself I always tell
      the truth even to my patients.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; groaned the patient. &ldquo;And after telling me that I hadn&rsquo;t more than a
      few days to live you now say my heart&rsquo;s all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re mad, my good fellow, mad! I said that you must go without the
      delay of a day for a change&mdash;a sea voyage if possible&mdash;and that
      in a week you&rsquo;d be as well as you ever were. Where&rsquo;s the letter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was lying on the side of the bed. The patient had read it again after
      he had thrown himself down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My God!&rdquo; cried the doctor, when he had brought it over to the lamp. &ldquo;An
      awful thing has happened. This is the letter that I wrote to Lois Perez,
      the diamond merchant, who visited me yesterday just before you came. My
      assistant must have put the letter that was meant for Perez into the
      envelope addressed to you, and your letter into the other cover. Great
      heavens!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The patient was sitting up in the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean to say that&mdash;that&mdash;I&rsquo;m all right?&rdquo; he gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course you&rsquo;re all right. You told me you wanted a sea voyage, and
      naturally I prescribed one for you to give you a chance of getting your
      leave without any trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The patient stared at the doctor for another minute and then fell back
      upon his pillow, turned his face to the wall, and wept.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only for a few minutes, however; then he suddenly sprang from the bed,
      caught the doctor by the collar of his coat, looked around for a weapon of
      percussion, picked up the pillow and forthwith began to belabour the
      physician with such vehemence that the Khânsâmah, who hurried into the
      room hearing the noise of the scuffle, fled from the compound, being
      certain that the Joy of the Whole World had become a maniac.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the lapse of about a minute the doctor was lying on the floor with
      the tears of laughter streaming down his cheeks and on to his disordered
      shirt-front, while the patient sat limp on a chair yelling with laughter&mdash;a
      trifle hysterically, perhaps. At the end of five minutes both were sitting
      over a bottle of champagne&mdash;not too dry&mdash;discussing the
      extraordinary effect of the imagination upon the human frame.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, by Jingo! I mustn&rsquo;t forget poor Lois Perez,&rdquo; cried the doctor,
      starting up. &ldquo;You may guess what a condition he is in when you know that
      the letter you read was meant for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By heavens, I can make a good guess as to his condition,&rdquo; said the
      patient. &ldquo;I was within measurable distance of that condition half an hour
      ago. But I&rsquo;m hanged if you are going to make any other poor devil as
      miserable as you made me. Let the chap die in peace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s something in what you say,&rdquo; said the doctor. &ldquo;I believe that I&rsquo;ll
      take your advice; only I must rescue your letter from him. If it were
      found among his effects after his death next week, I&rsquo;d be set down as
      little better than a fool for writing that he was generally sound but in
      need of a long sea voyage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He drove off to the house of the Portuguese dealer in precious stones, and
      on inquiring for him, learned that he had left in the afternoon by the
      mail steamer to take the voyage that the doctor had recommended. He meant
      to call at the Andamans, and then go on to Rangoon, the man in charge of
      the house said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;ll be an impressive burial service aboard that steamer before it
      arrives at the Andaman Islands,&rdquo; said the doctor to his wife as he told
      her what had occurred. The doctor was in a very anxious state lest the
      letter which the Portuguese had received should be found among his papers.
      His wife, however, took a more optimistic view of the situation. And she
      was right; for Lois Perez returned in due course from Rangoon with a very
      fine collection of rubies; and five years afterwards he had still
      sufficient strength left to get the better of me in the sale of a
      cat&rsquo;s-eye to which he perceived I had taken a fancy that was not to be
      controlled.

      CHAPTER X&mdash;THE VEGETARIAN AND OTHERS.

    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>O return to the
      sub-editors and their suppers, I may say that I never met but one
      vegetarian pressman. He was particularly fond of a supper dish to which
      the alluring name of Benjamin&rsquo;s Mess was given by the artful inventor. I
      do not know if the editor of this compilation had any authority&mdash;Biblical
      or secular&mdash;for assuming that its ingredients were identical with
      those with which Joseph, with the best of intentions, no doubt, but with
      very questionable prudence, heaped upon the dish of his youngest brother.
      I am not a profound Egyptologist, but I have a distinct recollection of
      hearing something about the fleshpots of Egypt, and the longing that the
      mere remembrance of these receptacles created in the hearts of the
      descendants of Joseph and his Brethren, when undergoing a course of
      enforced vegetarianism, though somewhat different in character from that
      to which, at a later period, Nebuchadnezzar&mdash;the most distinguished
      vegetarian that the world has ever known&mdash;was subjected. Therefore, I
      think it is only scriptural to assume that the original mess of Benjamin
      was something like a glorified Irish stew, or perhaps what yachtsmen call
      &ldquo;lobscouce,&rdquo; and that it contained at least a neck of mutton and a knuckle
      of ham&mdash;the prohibition did not exist in those days, and if the stew
      did not contain either ham or corned beef it would not be worth eating.
      But the compilation of which my friend was accustomed to partake nightly,
      and to which the vegetarian cookery book arrogates the patriarchal title,
      was wholly devoid of flesh-meat. It consisted, I believe, of some lentils,
      parsnips, a turnip, a head of cabbage or so, a dozen of leeks, a quart of
      split peas, a few vegetable marrows, a cucumber, a handful of green
      gooseberries, and a diseased potato to give the whole a piquancy that
      could not be derived from the other simple ingredients.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was frequently invited by the sub-editor to join him in his frugal
      supper, but invariably declined. I told him that I had no desire to
      convert my frame into a costermonger&rsquo;s barrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon one occasion the man failed to come down to the office when he was
      due. He appeared an hour later, looking very pale. His features suggested
      those of an overboiled cauliflower that has not been sufficiently strained
      after being removed from the saucepan. He explained to me the reason of
      his delay and of his overboiled appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fact is,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that I did not feel at all well this morning. For
      my breakfast I could only eat one covered dishful of peasepudding, a head
      or two of celery and a few carrots, with a tureen of lentil soup and a raw
      potato salad; so my wife thought she would tempt me with a delicacy for my
      dinner. She made me a bran pie all for myself&mdash;thirty-two Spanish
      onions and four Swedish turnips, with a beetroot or two for colouring, and
      a thick paste of oatmeal and bran&mdash;that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s called a bran pie.
      Confound the thing! It&rsquo;s too fascinating. I can never resist eating it
      all, and scraping the stable bucket in which it is cooked. I did so
      to-day, and that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m late. Well, well, perhaps I&rsquo;ll gain sense late
      in life. I don&rsquo;t feel quite myself even yet. Oh, confound all those dainty
      dishes! A man should stick to plain homely fare when he has work to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But on reflection I think that the most peculiar supper menus of the
      sub-editorial staff were those partaken of by two journalists who occupied
      the same room for close upon a year&mdash;a room to which I had access
      occasionally. One of these gentlemen was accustomed to place in a saucepan
      on the fire a number of unpeeled lemons with as much water as just covered
      them. After four hours&rsquo; stewing, this dainty midnight supper was supposed
      to be cooked. It certainly was eaten, and with very few indications, all
      things considered, of abhorrence, by the senior occupant of the
      sub-editor&rsquo;s room. He told me once in confidence that he really did not
      dislike the stewed lemons very much. He had heard that they were conducive
      to longevity, and in order to live long he was prepared to make many
      sacrifices. There could be little doubt, he said, that the virtue
      attributed to them was real, for he had been partaking of them for supper
      for over three years, and he had never suffered from anything worse than
      acute dyspepsia. I congratulated him. Nothing worse than acute dyspepsia!
    </p>
    <p>
      His stable companion, so to speak, did not believe in heavy hot suppers
      such as his colleague indulged in. He said it was his impression that no
      more light and salutary supper could be imagined than a single apple, not
      quite ripe.
    </p>
    <p>
      He acted manfully up to his belief, for every night I used to see him
      eating his apple shortly after midnight, and without offering the fruit
      the indignity of a paring. The spectacle was no more stimulating than that
      of the lemon-eater. My mouth invariably became so puckered up through
      watching the midnight banquets of these Sybarites, it was only with
      difficulty that I could utter a word or two of weak acquiescence in their
      views on a question of recognised difficulty.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is somewhat remarkable that the apple-eating sub-editor should be the
      one who was guilty of the most remarkable error I ever knew in connection
      with an attempted display of erudition. He had set out to write a lively
      little quarter-of-a-column leaderette on a topic which was convulsing
      society in those days&mdash;namely, the cruelty of boiling lobsters alive.
      I am not quite certain that the question has even yet been decided to the
      satisfaction either of the humanitarian who likes lobster salad, or of the
      lobster that finds itself potted. Perhaps the latter may some day come out
      of its shell and give us its views on the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      At any rate, in the year of which I write, the topic was almost a burning
      one: the month was September, Parliament had risen, and as yet the
      sea-serpent had not appeared on the horizon. The apple-eating sub-editor
      was doing duty for the assistant-editor, who was on his holidays; and as
      evidence of his light and graceful erudition, he asserted in his article
      that, however inhuman modern cooks might be in their preparation of
      Crustacea for the fastidious palates of their patrons, quite as great
      cruelty&mdash;assuming that it was cruelty&mdash;was in the habit of being
      perpetrated in cookery in the days of Shakespeare. &ldquo;Readers of the
      immortal bard of Avon,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;will recollect how, in one of the
      charming lyrics to &lsquo;Love&rsquo;s Labour&rsquo;s Lost,&rsquo; among the homely pleasures of
      winter it is stated that &lsquo;roasted crabs hiss in the bowl.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This reference to the preparation of crabs for the table makes it
      perfectly plain that it was quite common to cook them alive, for were it
      otherwise, how could they hiss? That listening to the expression of the
      suffering of the crabs should be regarded by Shakespeare as one of the
      joys of a household, casts a somewhat lurid light upon the condition of
      English Society in the sixteenth century.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the lemon-eating sub-editor who, on being requested by the editor
      to write something about the Zenana Mission, pointing out the great good
      that it was achieving, and the necessity there was for maintaining it in
      an efficient condition, produced a neat little article on the subject. He
      assured the readers of the paper that, among the many scenes of missionary
      labour, none had of late attracted more attention than the Zenana mission,
      and assuredly none was more deserving of this attention. Comparatively few
      years had passed since Zenana had been opened up to British trade, but
      already, owing to the devotion of a handful of men and women, the nature
      of the inhabitants had been almost entirely changed. The Zenanese, from
      being a savage people, had become, in a wonderfully short space of time,
      practically civilised; and recent travellers to Zenana had returned with
      the most glowing accounts of the continued progress of the good work in
      that country. The writer of the article then branched off into the
      &ldquo;labourer-worthy-of-his-hire&rdquo; side of this great evangelisation question&mdash;in
      most questions of missionary enterprise this side has a special interest
      attached to it&mdash;and the question was aptly asked if the devoted
      labourers in that remote vineyard were not deserving of support. Were
      civilisation and Christianity to be snatched from the Zenanese just when
      both were within their grasp? So on for nearly half a column the writer
      meandered in the most orthodox style, just as he had done scores of times
      before when advocating certain missions.
    </p>
    <p>
      I found him the next day running his finger down the letter Z, in the
      index to the Handy Atlas, with a puzzled look upon his face. I knew then
      that he had received a letter from the editor, advising him to look out
      Zenana in the Atlas before writing anything further about so ticklish a

      I also knew a sub-editor who fancied that the pibroch was a musical
      instrument widely circulated in the Highlands.
    </p>
    <p>
      But who can blame a humble provincial journalist for making an odd blunder
      occasionally, when a leading London newspaper, in announcing the death,
      some years ago, of Captain Wallace, son of Sir Richard Wallace, stated
      that the sad event had occurred while he was &ldquo;playing at bagatelle in the
      Bois de Boulogne&rdquo;? It might reasonably have been expected, I think, that
      the sub-editor of the foreign news should know of the existence of the
      historic mansion Bagatelle, which the Marquis of Hertford left to Sir
      Richard Wallace with the store of art treasures that it contained.

      What excuse, one may also ask, can be made for the Dublin Professor who
      referred in print &ldquo;to those populous districts of Hindostan, watered by
      the Ganges and the Deccan&rdquo;?

      In alluding to Frankenstein as the monster, and not merely the maker of
      the monster, the mistakes made by provincial journalists of the old school
      may certainly also be condoned, when we find the same ridiculous
      hallucination maintained by one of the most highly representative of
      modern journalists, as-well as by the editor of a weekly paper of large
      circulation, who enshrined it in the preface to a book for which he was
      responsible. In this case the writer could not have been pressed for time.
      But the marvel is, not that so many errors are run into by provincial
      journalists, but that so few can be laid to their charge. With telegrams
      pouring in by private wire, as well as by the P.A. and C.N., to say
      nothing of Baron Reuter&rsquo;s and Messrs, Dalziel&rsquo;s special services; with the
      foreman printer, too, appearing like a silent spectre and departing like
      one that is not silent, leaving the impression behind him that no
      newspaper, except that composed by a hated rival, can possibly be produced
      the next morning;&mdash;with all these drags upon the chariot wheels of
      composition, how can it be reasonably expected that an editor or a
      sub-editor will become Academic in his erudition? When, however, it is
      discovered the next day by some tenth-rate curate, who probably gets a
      free copy of the paper, that the quotation &ldquo;<i>O tempora! O mores!</i>&rdquo; is
      attributed to Virgil instead of Cicero, in a leading article a column in
      length, written upon a speech of seven columns, the writer is at once
      referred to as an ignorant boor, and an invitation is given to all that
      curate&rsquo;s friends to point the finger of scorn at the journalist.
    </p>
    <p>
      A long experience has convinced me that the curate who gets a free copy of
      the paper, and who is most velvet-gloved in approaching any member of the
      staff when he wants a favour, such as a leaderette on the Zenana Mission,
      in which several of his lady friends are deeply interested, or a paragraph
      regarding a forthcoming bazaar, or the insertion of a letter signed
      &ldquo;Churchman,&rdquo; calling attention to some imaginary reform which he himself
      has instituted&mdash;this very curate is the person who sends the marked
      copies of the paper to the proprietor with a gigantic <i>Sic</i> opposite
      every mistake, even though it be only a turned letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      I put a stop to the tricks of one of the race who had annoyed me
      excessively. I simply inserted verbatim a long letter that he wrote on
      some subject. It was full of mistakes, and to these the next day, in a
      letter which he meant to be humorous, he referred as &ldquo;printer&rsquo;s errors.&rdquo; I
      took the liberty of appending an editorial note to this communication,
      mentioning that the mistakes existed in the original letter, and adding
      that I trusted the writer would not think it necessary to attribute to the
      printer the further blunders which appeared in the humorous communication
      to which my note was appended.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fellow sought an interview with me the next day, and found it. He was
      furiously indignant at the course which I had adopted, and said I had
      taken advantage of the haste in which he had written both letters. I
      brought out of my desk forthwith a paper which he had taken the trouble to
      re-edit with red ink for the benefit of the proprietor, who had,
      naturally, handed it to me. I recognised the handwriting of the red-ink
      editor the moment I received the first of his letters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you make any allowance for the haste of the writers of these passages
      that you took the trouble to mark and send to the proprietor?&rdquo; I inquired
      blandly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He said he did not know what it was that I referred to; and added that it
      was a gratuitous assumption on my part to say that he had marked and sent
      the paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll assume that you deny having done so. May I do
      so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly you may,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I have something else to do beside
      pointing out the blunders of your staff.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I ask your pardon for having assumed that you marked the paper,&rdquo;
       said I. &ldquo;I was too hasty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were&mdash;quite too hasty,&rdquo; said he, going to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve acknowledged it,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;And therefore I&rsquo;ll not go to your rector
      until to-morrow evening to prove to him that his curate is a sneak and a
      liar as well as an extremely ignorant person.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He returned as I sat down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What paper is it that you allude to?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I showed it to you,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;It was the paper that you re-edited in red
      ink and posted anonymously to the proprietor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that?&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Why on earth didn&rsquo;t you say so at once? Of course I
      sent that paper. My dear fellow, it was only my little joke. I meant to
      have a little chaff with you about the mistakes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go away&mdash;go away,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Go away, <i>Stiggins</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he went away.

      I need scarcely say that such clergymen are not to be interviewed every
      day. Equally exceptional, I think, was the clergyman who was good enough
      to pay me a visit a few months after I had joined the editorial staff of a
      daily paper. Although I had never exactly been the leader of the coughers
      in church, yet on the other hand I had never been a leader of the scoffers
      outside it; and somehow the parson had come to miss me. I had an uneasy
      feeling when he entered my room that he had come on business&mdash;that he
      might possibly have fancied I was afflicted with doubts on, say, the right
      of unbaptised infants to burial in consecrated ground, and that he had
      come prepared to lift the burden from my soul; but he never so much as
      spoke of business until he had picked up his hat and gloves, and had said
      a cheerful farewell. Only then he remarked, as if the thing had occurred
      to him quite suddenly,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, by the way, I don&rsquo;t think I noticed you in church during the past few
      Sundays. I was afraid that you were indisposed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;I was all right; but the fact is, you see, that I&rsquo;ve
      become a sort of editor, and as I can never get to bed before three or
      four in the morning, it would be impossible for me to rise before eleven.
      To be sure I&rsquo;m not on duty on Saturday nights, but the force of habit is
      so great that, though I may go to bed in decent time on that night, I
      cannot sleep until my usual hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I see, I see,&rdquo; said he, beginning to draw on his gloves. &ldquo;Well,
      perhaps on the whole&mdash;all things considered&mdash;the&mdash;ah&mdash;&rdquo;
       here he was seized with a fit of coughing, and when he recovered he said
      he had always been an admirer of old Worcester, and he rather thought that
      some cups which I had on a shelf were, on the whole, the most
      characteristic as regards shape that he had ever seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he went away, and I perceived from the appearance that his back
      presented to me, that he would one day become a bishop. A clergyman with
      such tact as he exhibited can no more avoid being made a bishop than the
      young seal can avoid taking to the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before five years had passed he was, sure enough, raised to the Bench, and
      every one is delighted with him. The celery from the Palace garden
      invariably takes the first prize at the local shows; his lordship smiles
      when you congratulate him on his repeated successes with celery, but when
      you talk about chrysanthemums he becomes grave and shakes his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is his tact.

      The church of which he was rector was situated in a fashionable suburb of
      the town, and it possessed one of the noisiest peals of bells possible to
      imagine. They were the terror of the neighbourhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon one occasion an elderly gentleman living close to the church
      contracted some malady which necessitated, the doctor said, the observance
      of the strictest quiet, even on Sundays. A message was sent to the chief
      of the bellringers to this effect, the invalid&rsquo;s wife expressing the hope
      that for a Sunday or two the bells might be permitted to remain silent. Of
      course her very reasonable wish was granted. The chief of the ringers
      thoughtfully called every Sunday morning to inquire after the sufferer&rsquo;s
      condition, and for three weeks he learned that it was unchanged, and the
      bells consequently remained silent. On the fourth Sunday, he was told that
      the man had died during the night. He immediately hastened off to the
      other seven bellringers, worse than the first, and telling them that their
      prohibition was removed, they climbed the belfry and rang forth the most
      joyous peal that had ever annoyed the neighbourhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said the lady with whom I lodged, &ldquo;there are the joy bells once
      more. Poor Mr. Jenkins must be dead at last.&rdquo;

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span> FRIEND of mine
      once came to my office to invite me to an afternoon&rsquo;s rook-shooting. I was
      not in my room and he found me in the sub-editor&rsquo;s. I inquired about the
      trains to the place where the slaughter was to be done, and finding that
      they were satisfactory, agreed to join him on the following afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he turned to the sub-editor&mdash;a pleasant young fellow who had
      ideas of going to the bar&mdash;and asked him if he would care to come
      also. At first the sub-editor said he did not think he would be able to
      come, though he would like very much to do so. A little persuasion was
      sufficient to make him agree to be one of our party. He had not a gun of
      his own, he said, but a friend had frequently offered to lend him one, so
      that there would be no difficulty so far as that matter was concerned.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day I managed, as usual, just to catch the train as it began to
      move-away from the platform. My colleague on the newspaper had the door of
      the compartment open for me, and I could see the leather of his gun-case
      under the seat. I put my rook rifle&mdash;it was not in a case&mdash;in
      the network, and we had a delightful run through the autumn landscape to
      the station&mdash;it seemed miles from any village&mdash;where my friend
      was awaiting us in his dogcart, driving tandem. The drive of three miles
      to the rook-wood was exhilarating, and as we skirted some lines of old
      gnarled oaks, I perceived in a moment that we could easily fill a railway
      truck with birds, they were so plentiful. I made a remark to this effect
      to my friend, who was driving, and he said that when we arrived at the
      shooting ground and gave the birds the chance to which they were entitled
      we mightn&rsquo;t get more than a couple of hundred all told.
    </p>
    <p>
      The shooting ground was under a straggling tree about fifty yards from the
      ruin of an old castle, said to have been built by the Knights Templar.
      Here we dismounted from the dogcart, sending it a mile or two farther
      along the road in charge of the man, and got ready our rifles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What on earth have you got there?&rdquo; my friend inquired of the sub-editor,
      who was working at the gun-case.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the gun and cartridges,&rdquo; replied the young man; &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m not quite
      certain how to make fast the barrels to the stock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great heavens!&rdquo; cried my friend. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve brought a double-barrelled
      sporting gun to shoot rooks!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so he had.
    </p>
    <p>
      We tried to explain to him that for any human being to point such a weapon
      at a rook would be little short of murder, but he utterly failed to see
      the force of our arguments. He very good-humouredly said that, as we had
      come out to shoot rooks, he couldn&rsquo;t see how it mattered&mdash;especially
      to the rooks&mdash;whether they were shot with his gun or with our rook
      rifles. He added that he thought the majority of the birds were like Bob
      Acres, and would as lief be shot in an ungentlemanly as a gentlemanly
      attitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course it is impossible to argue with such a man. We only said that he
      must accept the responsibility for the butchery, and in this he cheerfully
      acquiesced, slipping cartridges into both barrels&mdash;the friend from
      whom he had borrowed the weapon had taught him how to do this.
    </p>
    <p>
      We soon found that at this point the breaking-strain of his information
      was reached. He had no more idea of sport than a butcher, or the <i>Sonttag
      jager</i> of the <i>Oberlander Blatter.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      As the rooks flew from the ruins to the belt of trees my friend and I
      brought down one each, and by the time we had reloaded, we were ready for
      two more, but I fired too soon, so that only one bird dropped. I saw the
      eyes of the man with the shot-gun gleam, &ldquo;his heart with lust of slaying
      strong,&rdquo; and he forthwith fired first one barrel and then the other at an
      old rook that cursed us by his gods, sitting on a branch of a tree ten
      yards off.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bird flapped heavily away, becoming more vituperative every moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; I shouted, &ldquo;you mustn&rsquo;t shoot at a bird that&rsquo;s sitting on a
      branch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh. yes,&rdquo; said my friend, with a grim smile. &ldquo;Oh, yes, he may. It&rsquo;ll do
      him no more harm than the birds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Not a bird did that young sportsman fire at except such as had assumed a
      sitting posture, and, incredible though it may seem, he only succeeded in
      killing one. But from the moment that his skill was rewarded by witnessing
      the downward flap of this one, the lust for blood seemed to take
      possession of him, as it does the young soldiers when their officers have
      succeeded in preventing them from blazing away at the enemy while still a
      mile off. He continued to load and fire at birds that were swaying on the
      trees beside us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a chance for you,&rdquo; said my friend, &ldquo;sarkastik-like,&rdquo; pointing to
      a rook that had flapped into a branch just above our heads.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man, his face pale and his teeth set, was in no mood for
      distinguishing between one tone of voice and another. He simply took half
      a dozen steps into the open and, aiming steadily at the bird, fired both
      barrels simultaneously. Down came the rook in the usual way, clawing from
      branch to branch. It remained, however, for several seconds on a bough
      about eight feet from the ground; then we had a vision of the sportsman
      clubbing his gun, and making a wild rush at his prey&mdash;and then came a
      crash and a cheer. The sportsman held aloft in one hand the tattered rook
      and in the other a double-barrelled gun with a broken stock.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had never fired a shot in his life before this day, and all his ideas
      of musketry were derived from the stories of pirates and buccaneers of the
      Spanish Main&mdash;wherever that may be&mdash;which had come to him for
      review. He thought that the clubbing of his weapon, in order to prevent
      the escape of the rook, quite a brilliant thing to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had, however, completely smashed the gun, and that, my friend said, was
      a step in the right direction. He could not do any more butchery with it
      that day.
    </p>
    <p>
      It cost him four pounds getting that gun repaired, and he confessed to me
      that, according to his experience, fowling was a greatly overrated sport.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      It was while we were driving to the train that my friend told me the story
      of Jack Burnaby&rsquo;s dogs&mdash;a story which he frankly confessed he had
      never yet got any human being to believe, but which was accurate in all
      its details, and could be fully verified by affidavit. He did not succeed
      in obtaining my credence for it. There are other forms of falsehood
      besides those verified by an affidavit, and I could not have given more
      implicit disbelief than I did to the story, even if it had formed the
      subject of this legal method of embodying a fiction.
    </p>
    <p>
      It appeared that never was there a more fastidious man in the matter of
      his sporting dogs than one Algy Grafton. Pointers that called for
      outbursts of enthusiasm on the part of other men&mdash;quite as good
      sportsmen as Algy&mdash;failed to obtain more than a complimentary word
      from him, and even this word of praise was grudgingly given and invariably
      tempered by many words which were certainly not susceptible of a
      eulogistic meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among his friends&mdash;such as declined to resent the insults which he
      put upon their dogs&mdash;there was a consensus of opinion that the animal
      which would satisfy him would not be born&mdash;allowing a reasonable time
      for the various processes of evolution&mdash;for at least a thousand
      years, and then, taking into consideration the growth of radical ideas,
      and the decay of the English sport, there would be little or no demand for
      a first-class dog in the British Islands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Algy Grafton had just acquired the Puttick-Foozler moor, and almost every
      post brought him a letter from his head-keeper describing the condition of
      the birds and the prospects of the Twelfth. Though the letters were
      written on a phonetic principle, the correctness of which was, of course,
      proportionate to the accuracy of a Scotchman&rsquo;s ear, and though the
      head-keeper was scarcely an optimist, still there was no mistaking the
      general tone of the information which Algy received through this source
      from the north: he gathered that he might reasonably look forward to the
      finest shoot on record.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every letter which he got from the moor, however, contained the expression
      of the keeper&rsquo;s hope that his master would succeed in his search for a
      couple of good dogs. The keeper&rsquo;s hope was shared by Algy; and he did
      little else during the month of July except interview dogs that had been
      recommended to him. He travelled north and south, east and west, to
      interview dogs; but so ridiculously fastidious was he that at the close of
      the first week in August he was still without a dog. He was naturally at
      his wit&rsquo;s end by this time, for as the Twelfth approached there was not a
      dog in the market. He telegraphed in all directions in the endeavour to
      secure some of the animals which he had rejected during the previous
      month, but, as might have been expected, the dogs were no longer to be
      disposed of: they had all been sold within a day or two after their
      rejection by Mr. Grafton. It was on the seventh of August that he got a
      letter from his correspondent on the moor, and in this letter the tone of
      mild remonstrance which the keeper had hitherto adopted in referring to
      his master&rsquo;s extravagant ideas on the dog question, was abandoned in
      favour of one of stern reprimand; in fact, some sentences were almost
      abusive. Mr. Donald MacKilloch professed to be anxious to know what was
      the good of his wearing out his life on the moor if his master did not
      mean to shoot on it. He hoped he would not be thought wanting in respect
      if he doubted the sanity of the policy of waiting without a dog until it
      pleased Providence&mdash;Mr. MacKilloch was a very religious man&mdash;to
      turn angels into pointers and saints into setters, a period which, it
      seemed to Mr. MacKilloch, his master was rather oversanguine in
      anticipating.

      It was not surprising that, after receiving this letter from the
      Highlands, Algy Grafton was somewhat moody as he strolled about his
      grounds on the morning of the eighth, nor was it remarkable that, when the
      rectory boy appeared with a letter stating that the Reverend Septimus
      Burnaby was anxious for him to run across in time to lunch at the rectory,
      to meet Jack Burnaby, who had just returned from Australia, Algy said that
      the rector and his brother Jack and all the squatters in the Australian
      colonies might be hanged together. Mrs. Grafton, however, whose life had
      not been worth a month&rsquo;s purchase since the dog problem had presented
      itself for solution, insisted on his going to the rectory to lunch, and he
      went. It was while smoking a cigar in the rectory garden with Jack
      Burnaby, who had spent all his life squatting, but with no apparent
      inconvenience to himself, that Algy mentioned that he was broken-hearted
      on account of his dogs. He gave a brief summary of his travels through
      England in search of trustworthy animals, and lamented his failure to
      obtain anything that could be depended on to do a day&rsquo;s work.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By George! you don&rsquo;t mean to say there&rsquo;s not a good dog in the market
      now?&rdquo; said Mr. Burnaby, the squatter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that&rsquo;s just what I do mean to say,&rdquo; cried Algy, so plaintively that
      even the stern and unbending MacKilloch might have pitied him. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
      just what I do mean to say. I&rsquo;d give fifty pounds to-day for a pair of
      dogs that I wouldn&rsquo;t have given ten pounds for a month ago. I&rsquo;m
      heart-broken&mdash;that&rsquo;s what I am!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cheer up!&rdquo; said Mr. Burnaby. &ldquo;I have a couple of sporting dogs that I&rsquo;ll
      lend to you until I return to the Colony in February next&mdash;the best
      dogs I ever worked with, and I&rsquo;ve had some experience.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was Providence that caused you to come across to me to-day, Grafton,&rdquo;
       said the rector piously, as Algy stood speechless among the trim rosebeds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re sure they&rsquo;re good?&rdquo; said Algy, his old suspicions returning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good?&mdash;am I sure?&mdash;oh, you needn&rsquo;t have them if you don&rsquo;t
      like,&rdquo; said the Australian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon a thousand times,&rdquo; cried Algy. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t fancy that I
      suggest that the dogs are not first rate. Oh, my dear fellow, I don&rsquo;t know
      how to thank you. I am&mdash;well, my heart is too full for words.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s not a man in England except yourself that I&rsquo;d lend them to,&rdquo; said
      Mr. Burnaby. &ldquo;I give you my word that I&rsquo;ve been offered forty pounds for
      each of them. Oh, there isn&rsquo;t a fault between them. They&rsquo;re just perfect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Algy was delighted, and for the remainder of the evening he kept assuring
      his poor wife that he was not quite such a fool as some people, including
      the Scotch keeper, seemed to fancy that he was.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had felt all along, he said, that just such a piece of luck as had
      occurred was in store for him, and it was on this account he had steadily
      refused to be gulled into buying any of the inferior animals that had been
      offered to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, yes, he assured her, he knew what he was about, and he&rsquo;d let
      MacKilloch know who it was that he had to deal with.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Australian&rsquo;s dogs were in the custody of a man at Southampton, but he
      promised to have them sent northward in good time. It was the evening of
      the eleventh when they arrived at the lodge. They were strange wiry
      brutes, and like no breed that Algy had ever seen. The head-keeper looked
      at them critically, and made some observations regarding them that did not
      seem grossly flattering. It was plain that if Mr. MacKilloch had conceived
      any sudden admiration for the dogs he contrived to conceal it. Algy said
      all that he could say, which was that Mr. Burnaby knew perfectly well what
      a dog was, and that a dog should be proved before it was condemned. Mr.
      MacKilloch, hearing this excellent sentiment, grunted.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day was a splendid Twelfth so far as the weather was concerned.
      Algy and his two friends were on the moor at dawn. At a signal from the
      head-keeper the dogs were put to their work. They seemed willing enough to
      work. Under their noses rose an old cock. To the horror of every one they
      made a snap for him, and missing him they rushed full speed through the
      heather in the direction he had taken, setting up birds right and left,
      and driving them by the score into the next moor. Algy stood aghast and
      speechless. It would be inaccurate to describe the attitude of Donald
      MacKilloch as passive. He was not silent. But in spite of his shouts&mdash;in
      spite of a fusi-lade of the strongest &ldquo;sweers&rdquo; that ever came from a
      God-fearing Scotchman with well-defined views of his own on the Free Kirk
      question, the two dogs romped over the moor, and the air was thick with
      grouse of all sorts and conditions, from the wary cocks to the incipient
      cheepers.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the credit of Algy Grafton it must be stated that he resolutely refused
      to allow a gun to be put into the hands of Donald MacKilloch. There was a
      blood-thirsty look in the keeper&rsquo;s eyes as now and again one of the dogs
      appeared among the clumps of purple heather. When they were tired out
      toward evening they were captured by one of the keepers, and led off the
      moor, Algy following them, for he feared that they might meet with an
      accident. He sent a telegram that night to their owner, and the next
      morning received the following reply:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The infernal idiot at Southampton sent you the wrong dogs. The right ones
      will reach you to-morrow. You have got a pair of the best kangaroo hounds
      in the world&mdash;worth five hundred guineas. Take care of them.&mdash;Burnaby.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Kangaroo hounds! kangaroo hounds!</i>&rdquo; murmured Algy with a far-away
      look in his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seems that he is not quite so fastidious about dogs as he used to be.

      When in the west of Ireland some years ago, pretending to be on the
      look-out for &ldquo;local colour&rdquo; for a novel, I heard, with about ten thousand
      others, a very amusing story regarding a gun. It was told to me by a man
      who was engaged in grazing a cow along the side of a ditch where I sat
      while partaking of a sandwich, fondly hoping that at sundown I might be
      able to look a duck or two straight in the face as the &ldquo;fly&rdquo; came over the
      smooth surface of the glorious lake along which the road skirted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your honour,&rdquo; said the narrator&mdash;he pronounced the words something
      like &ldquo;yer&rsquo;an&rsquo;r,&rdquo; but the best attempts to reproduce a brogue are
      ineffective&mdash;&ldquo;Your honour will mind how Mr. Egan was near having an
      accident just as he drew by the bit of stone wall beyond the entrance to
      his own gates?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;I remember hearing that he was fired at by some
      ruffian, and that his horse ran away with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s likely that that&rsquo;s the same story only told different. Maybe you
      never heard tell that it was Patsy Muldoon that was bid to do the job for
      Mr. Egan, God save him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never heard that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe not, sir. Ay, Patsy has repented for that shot, for it knocked the
      eye of him that far into the inside of his head that the doctors had no
      machine long enough to drag for it in the depths of his ould skull. Patsy
      wasn&rsquo;t a well-favoured boy before that night, and with the loss of his ear
      and the misplacement of his eye&mdash;it&rsquo;s not lost that it is, for it&rsquo;s
      somewhere in the inside of his head&mdash;he&rsquo;s not a beauty just now. You
      see, sir, Patsy Muldoon, Conn Moriarty, Jim Tuohy, and Tim Gleeson was all
      consarned in the business. They got the lend of a loan of ould Gleeson&rsquo;s
      gun, and the powder was in a half-pint whisky-bottle with a roll of paper
      for a cork, and every boy was supposed to bring his own bullets. Well,
      sir, ould Gleeson, before going quiet to his bed, had put a full charge of
      powder and a bullet down the throat of the gun, and had left her handy for
      Tim in the turf stack. But when Tim got a hoult of the wippon, he didn&rsquo;t
      know that the ould man had loaded her, and so he put another charge in
      her, and rammed it home to make sure. Then he slipped the bottle with the
      rest of the powder into his pocket and strolled down to the bit of dead
      wall&mdash;I suppose they call them dead walls, sir, because they&rsquo;re so
      convanient for such-like jobs. Anyhow, he laid down herself and the
      powder-bottle handy among the grass, and went back to the cabin, so as not
      to be suspected by the polis of interferin&rsquo; with the job that was Patsy&rsquo;s
      by right. Well, sir, my brave Conn was the next to come to the place, just
      to see that Tim hadn&rsquo;t played a thrick on him. He knew that it was all
      right when he saw herself lying among the grass, and as he didn&rsquo;t know
      that Tim had loaded her, he gave her a mouthful of powder himself and
      rammed down the lead. After him came my bould Tuohy, and, by the Powers,
      if he didn&rsquo;t load herself in proper style too. Last of all came Patsy that
      was to do the job&mdash;he&rsquo;d been consalin&rsquo; himself in the plantation, and
      it was barely time he had to put another charge into the ould gun, when
      Mr. Egan came up on his horse. Patsy slipped a cap on the nipple, and took
      a good aim from the side of the wall. When he pulled the trigger it&rsquo;s a
      dead corp that the gentleman would ha&rsquo; been only for the accident that
      occurred just then, for by some reason or other that nobody can account
      for, herself burst&mdash;a thing she&rsquo;d never done before&mdash;and Patsy&rsquo;s
      eye was druv into his head, and he was left searching by the aid of the
      other for the half of his ear, while Mr. Egan was a mile away on a mad
      horse. That&rsquo;s the story, your honour, only nobody can account to this day
      for the quare way that Patsy smiles when he sees a single barr&rsquo;l gun with
      the barr&rsquo;l a bit rusty.&rdquo;

      It was, I recollect, on the day following the rehearsal of this pretty
      little tale&mdash;the moral of which is that no man should shoot at a
      fellow man from the shelter of a crumbling wall, without having
      ascertained the exact numerical strength of the charges already within the
      barrel of the gun&mdash;that I was caught on the mountain in a shower of
      rain which penetrated my two coats within half-an-hour, leaving me in the
      condition of a bath sponge that awaits squeezing. While I was trickling
      down to the plains I met with the narrator of the story just recorded, and
      to him I explained that I was wet to the skin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if your honour&rsquo;s wet to the skin, and you with an overcoat on, how
      much worse amn&rsquo;t I that was out through all the shower with only a rag on
      my back?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It is said that it was in this neighbourhood that the driver of one of the
      &ldquo;long cars,&rdquo; on being asked by a tourist what was the name of a berry
      growing among the hedges, replied, &ldquo;Oh, them&rsquo;s blackberries, your honour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blackberries?&rdquo; said the tourist. &ldquo;But these are not black, but pink.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, sir; but blackberries is always pink when they&rsquo;re green,&rdquo; was
      the ready explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
      I cannot guarantee the novelty of this story; but I can certainly affirm
      that it is far more reasonable than the palpable invention regarding the
      nervous curate who is said to have announced that, &ldquo;next Tuesday, being
      Easter Monday, an open air meeting will be held in the vestry, to
      determine what colour the interior of the schoolhouse shall be whitewashed
      outside.&rdquo;

    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE chief of the
      reporting staff is usually the most important person connected with a
      provincial newspaper. It is not too much to say that it is in his power to
      make or to annihilate the reputation of a Town Councillor, or even a Poor
      Law Guardian. He may do so by the adoption of either of two systems: the
      first is persistent attention, the second is persistent neglect. He may
      either puff a man into a reputation, or puff him out of it. There are some
      men who become universally abhorred through being constantly alluded to as
      &ldquo;our respected townsman&rdquo;; such a distinction seems an invidious one to the
      twenty thousand townsmen who have never been so referred to. If a reporter
      persists in alluding to a certain person as &ldquo;our respected townsman,&rdquo; he
      will eventually succeed in making him the most highly disrespected burgess
      in the municipality, if he was not so before.&rsquo; On the other hand a
      reporter may, by judicious neglect of a burgess who burns for distinction,
      destroy his chances of becoming a Town Councillor; and, perhaps, before he
      dies, Mayor. But my experience leads me to believe that if a reporter has
      a grudge against a Town Councillor, a Poor Law Guardian, or a Borough
      Magistrate, and if he is really vindictive, the most effective course of
      vengeance that he can adopt is to record verbatim all that his enemy
      utters in public. The man who exclaimed, at a period of the world&rsquo;s
      history when the publishing business had not attained its present
      proportions, &ldquo;Oh that mine enemy had written a book!&rdquo; knew what he was
      talking about. &ldquo;Oh that mine enemy were reported verbatim!&rdquo; would
      assuredly be the modern equivalent of the bitter cry of the patriarch. The
      stutterings, the vain repetitions, and the impossible grammar which
      accompany the public utterances&mdash;imbecile only when they are not
      commonplace&mdash;of the average Town Councillor or Poor Law Guardian,
      would require the aid of the phonograph to admit of their being anly when
      they are not commonplace&mdash;of the average Town Councillor or Poor Law
      Guardian, would require the aid of the phonograph to admit of their being
      adequately depreciated by the public.
    </p>
    <p>
      The worst offenders are those men who are loudest in their complaints
      against the reporters, and who are constantly writing to correct what they
      call &ldquo;errors&rdquo; in the summary of their speeches. A reporter puts in a
      grammatical and a moderately reasonable sentence or two the ridiculous
      maunderings and wanderings of one of these &ldquo;public men,&rdquo; and the only
      recognition he obtains assumes the form of a letter to the editor,
      pointing out the &ldquo;omissions&rdquo; made in the summary. Omissions! I should
      rather think there were omissions.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have no hesitation in affirming that the verbatim reporting of their
      speeches would mean the annihilation of ninety-nine out of every hundred
      of these municipal orators.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only once, on a paper with which I was connected, had a reporter the
      courage to try the effect of a literal report of the speech of a man who
      was greatly given to complaining of the injustice done to him in the
      published accounts of his deliverances. Every &ldquo;haw,&rdquo; &ldquo;hum,&rdquo; &ldquo;ah,&rdquo; &ldquo;eh&mdash;eh;&rdquo;
       every repetition, every reduplication of a repetition, every unfinished
      sentence, every singular nominative to a plural verb, every artificial
      cough to cover a retreat from an imbecile statement, was reported. The
      result was the complete abatement of this nuisance. A considerable time
      elapsed before another complaint as to omissions in municipal speeches was
      made.

    <p>
      To my mind, the ability and the judgment shown by the members of the
      reporting staff cannot be too warmly commended. It is not surprising that
      occasionally attempts should be made by warm-hearted persons to express in
      a substantial way their recognition of the talents of this department of a
      newspaper. I have several times known of sums of money being offered to
      reporters in the country, with a view of obtaining the insertion of
      certain paragraphs or the omission of others. Half-a-crown was invariably
      the figure at which the value of such services was assessed. I am still of
      the opinion that this was not an extravagant sum to offer a presumably
      educated man for running the risk of losing his situation. Curiously
      enough, the majority of these offers of money came from competitors at
      ploughing matches, at exhibitions of oxen and swine, and at flower shows.
      Why agriculturalists should be more zealous to show their appreciation of
      literary work than the rest of the population it would be difficult to
      say; but at one time&mdash;a good many years ago&mdash;I heard so much
      about the attempted distribution of half-crowns in agricultural districts,
      I began to fear that at the various shows it would be necessary to have a
      placard posted, bearing the words: &ldquo;GRATUITIES TO REPORTERS STRICTLY
      PROHIBITED.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Many years ago I was somewhat tired of hearing about the numerous insults
      offered to reporters in this way. A head-reporter once told me that a
      junior member of his staff had come to him after a day in the country,
      complaining bitterly that he had been grossly insulted by an offer of
      money.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what did you say to him?&rdquo; I inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I asked him how much he had been offered,&rdquo; replied the head-reporter,
      &ldquo;and when he said, &lsquo;Half-a-crown,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;Pooh! half-a-crown! that
      wasn&rsquo;t much of an insult. How would you like to be offered a sovereign, as
      I was one day in the same neighbourhood? You might talk of your insults
      then.&rsquo; That shut him up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I did not doubt it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think the juniors protest too much?&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reporter laughed shrewdly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You remember <i>Punch&rsquo;s</i> picture of the man lying drunk on the
      pavement, and the compassionate lady in the crowd who asked if the poor
      fellow was ill, at which a man says, &lsquo;Ill? &lsquo;im ill? I only wish I&rsquo;d alf
      his complaint&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I admitted that I had a vivid recollection of the picture; but I added
      that I could not see what it had to say to the subject we were discussing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again the reporter smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you had seen the chap&rsquo;s face to-day when I talked of the sovereign you
      would know what I meant; his face said quite plainly, &lsquo;I wish I had half
      of that insult.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That view was quite intelligible to me some time after, when a reporter,
      whose failings were notorious, came to me with the old story. He had been
      offered half-a-crown by a man in a good social position who had been fined
      at the police court that day for being drunk and assaulting a constable,
      and who was anxious that no record of the transaction should appear in the
      newspaper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great heavens!&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;he had the face to offer you half-a-crown?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He had,&rdquo; said the reporter, indignantly. &ldquo;Half-a-crown! The low hound! He
      knew that if I included his case in to-morrow&rsquo;s police news he would lose
      his situation, and yet he had the face to offer me half-a-crown. What
      hounds there are in the world! Two pounds would have been little enough.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <p>
      I never heard of a Town Councillor offering a bribe to a reporter; but I
      have heard of something more phenomenal&mdash;a Town Councillor
      indignantly rejecting what he conceived to be a bribe. He took good care
      to boast of it afterwards to his constituents. It happened that this
      Councillor was the leader of a select faction of three on the Corporation,
      whose <i>métier</i> consisted in opposing every scheme that was brought
      forward by the Town Clerk, and supported by the other members of the
      Corporation. Now the Town Clerk had hired a shooting one autumn, and as
      the birds were plentiful, he thought that it would be a graceful act on
      his part to send a brace of grouse to every Alderman and every Councillor.
      He did so, and all the members of the Board accepted the transaction in a
      right spirit&mdash;all, except the leader of the opposition faction. He
      explained his attitude to his constituents as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen, you&rsquo;ll all be glad to hear that I&rsquo;ve made myself formidable to
      our enemies. I&rsquo;ve brought the so-called Town Clerk down on his knees to
      me. An attempt was made to bribe me last week, which I am determined to
      expose. One night when I came home from my work, I found waiting for me a
      queer pasteboard box with holes in it. I opened it, and inside I found a
      couple of fat <i>brown pigeons</i>, and on their legs a card printed &lsquo;With
      Mr. Samuel White&rsquo;s compliments.&rsquo; &lsquo;Mr. Samuel White! That&rsquo;s the Town
      Clerk,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;and if Mr. Samuel White thinks to buy my silence by
      sending me a pair of brown pigeons with Mr. Samuel White&rsquo;s compliments,
      Mr. Samuel White is a bit mistaken;&rsquo; so I just put the pigeons back into
      their box, and redirected them to Mr. Samuel White, and wrote him a polite
      note to let him know that if I wanted a pair of pigeons I could buy them
      for myself. That&rsquo;s what I did.&rdquo; (Loud cheers.)
    </p>
    <p>
      When it was explained to him some time after that the birds were grouse,
      and not pigeons, he asked where was the difference. The principle would be
      precisely the same, he declared, if the birds were eagles or ostriches.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      It has often occurred to me that for the benefit of such men, a complete
      list should be made out of such presents as may be legitimately received
      from one&rsquo;s friends, and of those that should be regarded as insultive in
      their tendency. It must puzzle a good many people to know where the line
      should be drawn. Why should a brace of grouse be looked on as a graceful
      gift, while a pair of fowl&mdash;a &ldquo;yoke,&rdquo; they are called in the West of
      Ireland&mdash;can only be construed as an affront? Why should a haunch of
      venison (when not over &ldquo;ripe&rdquo;) constitute an acceptable gift, while a
      sirloin of prime beef could only be regarded as having an eleemosynary
      signification? Why may a lover be permitted to offer the object of his
      attachment a fan, but not a hat? a dozen of gloves, but not a pair of
      boots? These problems would tax a much higher intelligence&mdash;if it
      would be possible to imagine such&mdash;than that at the command of the
      average Town Councillor.

    <p>
      It was the same member of the Corporation who, one day, having succeeded&mdash;greatly
      to his astonishment&mdash;in carrying a resolution which he had proposed
      at a meeting, found that custom and courtesy necessitated his providing
      refreshment for the dozen of gentlemen who had supported him. His ideas of
      refreshment revolved round a public-house as a centre; but when it was
      explained to him that the occasion was one that demanded a demonstration
      on a higher level, and with a wider horizon, he declared, in the
      excitement of the moment, that he was as ready as any of his colleagues to
      discharge the duties of host in the best style. He took his friends to a
      first-class restaurant, and at a hint from one of them, promptly ordered a
      couple of bottles of champagne. When these had been emptied, the host gave
      the waiter a shilling, telling him in a lordly way to keep the change. The
      waiter was, of course, a German, and, with a smile and a bow, he put the
      coin into his pocket, and hastened to help the gentlemen on with their
      overcoats. When they were trooping out, he ventured to enquire whom the
      champagne was to be charged to.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hospitable Councillor stared at the man, and then expressed the
      opinion that all Frenchmen, and perhaps Italians, were the greatest rogues
      unhung.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You savey!&rdquo; he shouted at the waiter&mdash;for like many persons on the
      social level of Town Councillors, he assumed that all foreigners are a
      little deaf,&mdash;&ldquo;You savey, I give you one shilling&mdash;one bob&mdash;you
      savey!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The waiter said he was &ldquo;much oblige,&rdquo; but who was to pay for the
      champagne?
    </p>
    <p>
      The gentlemen who had partaken of the champagne nudged one another, but
      one of them was compassionate, and explained to the Councillor that the
      two bottles involved the expenditure of twenty-four shillings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twenty-eight shillings,&rdquo; the waiter murmured in a submissive,
      subject-to-the-correction-of-the-Court tone. The wine was Heidsieck of
      &lsquo;74, he explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Councillor gasped, and then smiled weakly. He had been made the
      subject of a jest more than once before, and he fancied he saw in the
      winks of the men around him, a loophole of escape from an untenable
      position.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no more time to waste. Don&rsquo;t you flatter
      yourselves that I can&rsquo;t see this is a put-up job between you all and the
      waiter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pay the man the money and be hanged to you!&rdquo; said an impetuous member of
      the party.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just then the manager of the restaurant strolled up, and received with a
      polite smile the statement of the hospitable. Councillor regarding what he
      termed the barefaced attempt to swindle on the part of the German waiter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said the manager, &ldquo;the price of the wine is on the card. Here it
      is,&rdquo;&mdash;he whipped a card out of his pocket. &ldquo;&lsquo;Heidsieck&mdash;1874&mdash;14s.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The generous host fell back on a chair speechless.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had any of his friends ever read Hamlet they would certainly not have
      missed quoting the lines:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      &ldquo;Indeed this (Town) Councillor
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Is now most still, most secret, and most grave,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Who was in life&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Well&mdash;otherwise. However, <i>Hamlet</i> remained unquoted.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a long pause he recovered his powers of speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that&rsquo;s champagne&mdash;that&rsquo;s champagne!&rdquo; he said in a weak voice,
      &ldquo;Champagne! By the Lord Harry, I&rsquo;ve tasted better ginger-beer!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He has lately been very cautious in bringing forward any resolutions at
      the Corporation. He is afraid that another of them may chance to be
      carried.

      The reporter who told me the story which I have just recorded, was an
      excellent specimen of the class&mdash;shrewd, a capital judge of
      character, and a good organiser. He had, however, never got beyond the
      stereotyped phrases which appear in every newspaper&mdash;indeed, there
      was no need for him to get beyond them. Every death &ldquo;cast a gloom&rdquo; over
      the locality where it occurred; and a chronicle of the weather at any time
      during the month of March caused him to let loose the journalist&rsquo;s lion
      upon an unsuspecting public.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once it occurred to me that he went a little too far with the gloom that
      he kept, as Captain Mayne Reid&rsquo;s Mexicans kept their lassoes, ready to
      cast at a moment&rsquo;s notice.
    </p>
    <p>
      He wrote an account of a fire which had caused the death of two persons,
      and concluded as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The conflagration, which was visible at a distance of four miles, and was
      not completely subjugated until a late hour, cast a gloom over the entire
      quarter of the town, that will be felt for long, more especially as the
      premises were wholly uninsured.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yes, I thought that this was carrying the gloom a little too far.
    </p>
    <p>
      I will say this for him, however: it was not he who wrote: &ldquo;A tall but
      well-dressed man was yesterday arrested on suspicion of being concerned in
      a recent robbery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nor was it he who headed a paragraph, &ldquo;Fatal Death by Drowning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      In a town in which I once resided the coroner died, and there was quite a
      brisk competition for the vacant office. The successful candidate was a
      gentleman whose claims had been supported by a newspaper with which I was
      connected. Three months afterwards the proofreader brought under the
      notice of the sub-editor in my presence a paragraph which had come from
      the reporter&rsquo;s room, and which had already been &ldquo;set up.&rdquo; So nearly as I
      can remember, it was something like this:&mdash;&ldquo;Yesterday, no fewer than
      three inquests were held in various parts of this town by our highly
      respected coroner. Indeed, any doubts that may possibly have existed as to
      the qualification of this gentleman for the coronership, among those
      narrowminded persons who opposed his selection, must surely be dispelled
      by reference to the statistics of inquests held during the three months
      that he has been in office. The increase upon the corresponding quarter
      last year is thirteen, or no less than 9.46 per cent. Compared with the
      immediately preceding quarter the figures are no less significant,
      showing, as they do, an increase of seventeen, or 12.18 per cent. In other
      words, the business of the coroner has been augmented by one-eighth since
      he came into office. This fact speaks volumes for the enterprise and
      ability of the gentleman whose candidature it was our privilege to
      support.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Of course this paragraph was suppressed. The sub-editor told me the next
      day that it had been written by a junior reporter, who had misunderstood
      the instructions of his chief. The fact was that the coroner wanted an
      increase of remuneration,&mdash;he was paid by a fixed salary, not by
      &ldquo;piece work,&rdquo; so to speak,&mdash;and he had suggested to the chief
      reporter that a paragraph calling attention to the increase of inquests in
      the town might have a good effect. The chief reporter had given the
      figures to a junior, with a few hasty instructions, which he had somehow
      misinterpreted.

    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span> REPORTER is now
      and again compelled to exercise other powers than those which are
      generally supposed to be at the command of the writer of shorthand and the
      paragraphist. I knew a very clever youth who in a crisis showed of what he
      was capable. There was, in the town where we lived, a society of very
      learned men and equally learned women. Once a fortnight a paper was read,
      usually on some point of surpassing dulness&mdash;this was in the good old
      days, when lectures were solemn and theatres merry. Just at present, I
      need scarcely say, the position of the two is reversed: the theatres are
      solemn (the managers, becoming pessimistic by reason of their losses,
      endeavour to impress their philosophy upon the public), but the
      lecture-room rings with laughter as some <i>savant</i> treats of the
      &ldquo;Loves of Coleoptera&rdquo; with limelight illustrations, or &ldquo;The Infant
      Bacillus.&rdquo; The society which I have mentioned had engaged as lecturer for
      a certain evening a local architect, who had largely augmented his
      professional standing by a reputation for conviviality; and the subject
      with which he was to deal was &ldquo;Early Architecture.&rdquo; A brother professional
      man, whose sympathies were said to extend in many directions, had promised
      to take the chair upon this occasion. It so happened, however, that, owing
      to his pressing but unspecified engagements, the lecturer found himself,
      on the day for which the lecture was announced, still in doubt as to the
      sequence that his views should assume when committed to paper. About noon
      on this day he strolled into the office of the gentleman who was
      advertised to take the chair in the evening, and explained that he should
      like to discuss with him the various aspects of the question of Early
      Architecture, so that his mind might be at ease on appearing before the
      audience.
    </p>
    <p>
      They accordingly went down the street, and made an earnest inspection of
      the interior of a cave-dwelling in the neighbourhood&mdash;it was styled
      &ldquo;The Cool Grot,&rdquo; and tradition was respected by the presence therein of
      shell-fish, oat-cake, and other elementary foods, with various samples of
      alcohol in a rudimentary form. In this place the brother architects
      discussed the subject of Early Architecture until, as a reporter would
      say, &ldquo;a late hour.&rdquo; The result was not such as would have a tendency to
      cause an unprejudiced person to accept without some reserve the theory
      that on a purely æsthetic question, a just conclusion can most readily be
      arrived at by a friendly discussion amid congenial surroundings.
    </p>
    <p>
      A small and very solemn audience had assembled some twenty minutes or so
      before the lecturer and chairman put in an appearance, and then no time
      was lost in commencing the business of the meeting. The one architect was
      moved to the chair, and seconded, and he solemnly took it. Having
      explained that he occupied his position with the most pleasurable
      feelings, he poured himself out a glass of water with a most unreasonable
      amount of steadiness, and laid the carafe exactly on the spot&mdash;he was
      most scrupulous on this point&mdash;it had previously occupied. He drank a
      mouthful of the water, and then looked into the tumbler with the shrewd
      eye of the naturalist searching for infusoria. Then he laughed, and told a
      story that amused himself greatly about a friend of his who had attended a
      temperance lecture, and declared that it would have been a great success
      if the lecturer had not automatically attempted to blow the froth off the
      glass of water with which he refreshed himself. Then he sat down and fell
      asleep, before the lecturer had been awakened by the secretary to the
      committee, and had opened his notes upon the desk. For about ten minutes
      the lecturer made himself quite as unintelligible as the most erudite of
      the audience could have desired; but then he suddenly lapsed into
      intelligibility&mdash;he had reached that section of his subject which
      necessitated the recitation of a poem said to be in a Scotch dialect,
      every stanza of which terminated with the words, &ldquo;A man&rsquo;s a man for a&rsquo; 
      that!&rdquo; He then bowed, and, recovering himself by a grasp of the desk,
      which he shook as though it were the hand of an old schoolfellow whom he
      had not met for years, he retired with an almost supernatural erectness to
      his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a moment the chairman was on his feet&mdash;the sudden silence had
      awakened him. In a few well-chosen phrases he thanked the audience for the
      very hearty manner in which they had drunk his health. He then told them a
      humorous story of his boyhood, and concluded by a reference to one &ldquo;Mr.
      Vice,&rdquo; whom he trusted frequently to see at the other end of the table,
      preparatory to going beneath it. He hoped there was no objection to his
      stating that he was a jolly good fellow. No absolute objection being made,
      he ventured on the statement&mdash;in the key of B flat; the lecturer
      joined in most heartily, and the solemn audience went to their homes,
      followed by the apologies of the secretary to the committee.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chairman and the lecturer were then shaken up by the old man who came
      to turn out the lights. He turned them out as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, the reporter who had been &ldquo;marked&rdquo; for that lecture found that he had
      some much more important business to attend to. He did not reach the
      newspaper office until late, and then he seated himself, and thoughtfully
      wrote out the remarks which nine out of every ten chairmen would have
      made, attributing them to the gentleman who presided at the lecture; and
      then gave a general summary of the lecture on &ldquo;Early Architecture&rdquo; which
      ninety-nine out of every hundred working architects would deliver if
      called on. He concluded by stating that the usual vote of thanks was
      conveyed to the lecturer, and suitably acknowledged by him, and that the
      audience was &ldquo;large, representative, and enthusiastic.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The secretary called upon the proprietor of the paper the next day, and
      expressed his high appreciation of the tact and judgment of the reporter;
      and the proprietor, who was more accustomed to hear comments on the
      display of very different attainments on the part of his staff, actually
      wrote a letter of commendation to the reporter, which I think was well
      earned.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most remarkable point in connection with this occurrence was the
      implicit belief placed in the statements of the newspaper, not only by the
      public&mdash;for the public will believe anything&mdash;but also by the
      architect-lecturer and the architect-chairman. The professional standing
      of the former was certainly increased by the transaction, and till the day
      of his death he was accustomed to allude to his lecture on &ldquo;Early
      Architecture.&rdquo; The secretary to the committee, for his own credit&rsquo;s sake,
      said nothing about the fiasco, and the solemn members of the audience were
      so accustomed to listen to incomprehensible lectures in the same room that
      they began to think that the performance at which they had &ldquo;assisted&rdquo; was
      only another of the usual type, so they also held their peace on the
      matter.

      Having introduced this society, I cannot refrain from telling the story of
      another transaction in which it was concerned. The ramifications of the
      society extended in many directions, and a more useful organisation could
      scarcely be imagined. It was like an elephant&rsquo;s trunk, which can uproot a
      tree&mdash;if the elephant is in a good humour&mdash;but which does not
      disdain to pick up a pin&mdash;like the boy who afterwards became Lord
      Mayor of London. The society did not shrink from discussing the question
      &ldquo;Is a Monarchy or a Republic the right form of Government?&rdquo; on the same
      night that it dealt with a new stopper for soda-water bottles. The
      Carboniferous Future of England was treated of upon the same evening as
      the Immortality of the Soul; perhaps there is a closer connection than at
      first meets the eye between the two subjects. It took ancient buildings
      under its protection, as well as the most recently fabricated pre-historic
      axe-head; and it was the discharge of its functions in regard to ancient
      buildings that caused the committee to pass a resolution one day, calling
      on their secretary to communicate with the owner of a neighbouring
      property, in the midst of which a really fine ruin of an ancient castle,
      with many interesting associations, was situated, begging him to order a
      wall to be built around the ruins, so as to prevent them from continuing
      to be the resort of cows with a fine taste in archaeology, when the summer
      days were warm and they wanted their backs scratched.
    </p>
    <p>
      The property was in Ireland, consequently the landlord lived in England,
      and had never so much as seen the ruins. It was news to him that anything
      of interest was to be found on his Irish estates; but as his son was
      contemplating the possibility of entering Parliament as the representative
      of an Irish borough, he at once crossed the Channel, had an interview with
      the society&rsquo;s secretary, and, with the president, visited the old castle,
      and was delighted with it. He sent for his bailiff, and told him that he
      wanted a wall four feet high to be built round the field in the centre of
      which the ruins lay&mdash;he even went so far as to &ldquo;peg out,&rdquo; so to
      speak, the course that he wished the wall to take.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Irish bailiff stared at his master, but expressed the delight it would
      give him to carry out his wishes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The owner crossed to England, promising to return in three months to see
      how the work had been done.
    </p>
    <p>
      He kept his word. He returned in three months, and found, sure enough,
      that an excellent wall had been built on the exact lines he had laid down,
      but every stone of the ruins of the ancient castle had disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bailiff stood by with a beaming face as he explained how the ruins had
      gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>He had caused the wall to be built out of the stones of the ancient
      castle, to save expense.</i>

      If reporters were only afforded a little leisure, any one of them who has
      lived in a large town could compile an interesting volume of his
      experiences. I have often regretted that I could never master the art of
      shorthand. I worked at it for months when a boy, and made sufficient
      progress to be able to write it pretty fairly; but writing is not
      everything. The capacity for transcribing one&rsquo;s notes is something to be
      taken into account; and it was at this point that I broke down, and was
      forced to become a novelist&mdash;a sort of novelist. The first time that
      I went up country in Africa, my stock of paper being limited, I carried
      only two pocket-books, and economised my space by taking my notes in
      shorthand. I had no occasion to refer to these notes until I was writing
      my novel &ldquo;Daireen,&rdquo; and then I found myself face to face with a hundred
      pages of hieroglyphs which were utterly unintelligible to me. In despair I
      brought them to a reporter, and he read them off for me much more rapidly
      than he or anyone else could read my ordinary handwriting to-day. In fact,
      he read just a little too fast,&mdash;I was forced to beg him to stop.
      There are some occurrences of which one takes a note in shorthand in one&rsquo;s
      youth in a strange country, but which one does not wish particularly to
      offer to the perusal of strangers years afterwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      But although I could never be a reporter, I now and again availed myself
      of a reporter&rsquo;s privileges, when I wished to be present at a trial that
      promised some interesting features to a student of good and evil. It
      seemed to me that the Parnell Commission was an epitome of the world&rsquo;s
      history from the earliest date. No writer has yet done justice to that
      extraordinary incident. I have asked some reporters, who were present day
      after day, if they intended writing a real history of the Commission; not
      the foolish political history of the thing, but the story of all that was
      laid bare to their eyes hour after hour,&mdash;the passions of patriotism,
      of power, of hate, of revenge; the devotion to duty, the dogged heroism,
      the religious fervour; every day brought to light such examples of these
      varied attributes of the Irish nature as the world had never previously
      known.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reporters said they had no time to devote to such thankless work; and,
      besides, every one was sick of the Commission.
    </p>
    <p>
      Often as I went into the court and faced the scene, it never lost its
      glamour for me. Every day I seemed to be wandering through a world of
      romance. I could not sleep at night, so deeply impressed was I with the
      way certain witnesses returned the scrutiny of Sir Charles Russell; with
      the way Mr. Parnell hypnotised others; with the stories of the awful
      struggle of which Ireland was the centre.
    </p>
    <p>
      Going out of the courts one evening, I came upon an old man standing with
      his hat off and with one arm uplifted in an attitude of denunciation that
      was tragic beyond description. He was a handsome old man, very tall, but
      slightly stooped, and he clearly occupied a good position in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were alone just outside the courts. I pretended that I had suddenly
      missed something. I stood thrusting my hands into my pockets and feeling
      between the buttons of my coat, for I meant to watch him. At last I pulled
      out my cigarette-case and strolled on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were in that court?&rdquo; the old man said, in a tone that assured me I
      had not underestimated his social position.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not wait for me to reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You saw that man sitting with his cold impassive face while the tears
      were on the cheeks of every one else? Listen to me, sir! I called upon the
      Most High to strike him down&mdash;to strike him down&mdash;and my prayer
      was heard. I saw him lying, disgraced, deserted, dead, before my eyes; and
      so I shall see him before a year has passed. &lsquo;Mene, mene, tekel,
      upharsin.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again he raised his arm in the direction of the court, and when I saw the
      light in his eyes I knew that I was looking at a prophet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly he seemed to recover himself. He put on his hat and turned round
      upon me with something like angry surprise. I raised my hat. He did the
      same. He went in one direction and I went in the opposite.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a false prophet. Mr. Parnell was not dead within the year. In fact,
      he was not dead until two years and two months had passed. In accordance
      with the thoughtful provisions of the Mosaic code, that old gentleman
      deserved to be stoned for prophesying falsely. But his manner would almost
      have deceived a reporter.

      Having introduced the subject of the Parnell Commission, I may perhaps be
      permitted to express the hope that Sir Charles Russell will one day find
      sufficient leisure to give us a few chapters of his early history. I
      happen to know something of it. I am fully acquainted with the nature of
      some of its incidents, which certainly would be found by the public to
      possess many interesting and romantic elements; though, unlike the
      romantic episodes in the career of most persons, those associated with the
      early life of Sir Charles Russell reflect only credit upon himself. Every
      one should know by this time that the question of what is Patriotism and
      what is not is altogether dependent upon the nature of the Government of
      the country. In order to prolong its own existence for six months, a
      Ministry will take pains to alter the definition of the word Patriotism,
      and to prosecute every one who does not accept the new definition. Forty
      years ago the political lexicon was being daily revised. I need say no
      more on this point; only, if Sir Charles Russell means to give us some of
      the earlier chapters of his life he should lose no time in setting about
      the task. A Lord Chief Justice of England cannot reasonably be expected to
      deal with any romantic episodes in his own career, however important may
      be the part which he feels himself called on now and again to take in the
      delimitation of the romantic elements (of a different type) in the careers
      of others of Her Majesty&rsquo;s subjects.

    <p>
      It may surprise some of those persons who have been unfortunate enough to
      find themselves witnesses for the prosecution in cases where Sir Charles
      Russell has appeared for the defence, to learn that in his young days he
      was exceedingly shy. He has lost a good deal of his early diffidence, or,
      at any rate, he manages to prevent its betraying itself in such a way as
      might tend to embarrass a hostile witness. As a rule, the witnesses do not
      find that bashfulness is the most prominent characteristic of his
      cross-examination. But I learned from an early associate of Sir Charles&rsquo;s,
      that when his name appeared on the list to propose or to respond to a
      toast at one of the dinners of a patriotic society of which my informant
      as well as Sir Charles was a member, he would spend the day nervously
      walking about the streets, and apparently quite unable to collect his
      thoughts. Upon one occasion the proud duty devolved upon him of responding
      to the toast, &ldquo;Ireland a Nation!&rdquo; Late in the afternoon my informant, who
      at that time was a small shopkeeper&mdash;he is nothing very considerable
      to-day&mdash;found him in a condition of disorderly perturbation, and
      declaring that he had no single idea of what he should say, and he felt
      certain that unless he got the help of the man who afterwards became my
      informant he must inevitably break down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I laughed at him,&rdquo; said the gentleman who had the courage to tell the
      story which I have the courage to repeat, &ldquo;and did my best to give him
      confidence. &lsquo;Sure any fool could respond to &ldquo;Ireland a Nation!&rdquo;&rsquo; said I;
      &lsquo;and you&rsquo;ll do it as well as any other.&rsquo; But even this didn&rsquo;t give him
      courage,&rdquo; continued my informant, &ldquo;and I had to sit down and give him the
      chief points to touch on in his speech. He wrung my hand, and in the
      evening he made a fine speech, sir. Man, but it was a pity that there
      weren&rsquo;t more of the party sober enough to appreciate it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I tell this tale as it was told to me, by a respectable tradesman whose
      integrity has never been questioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      It occurred to me that that quality in which, according to his interesting
      reminiscence of forty years ago, his friend Russell was deficient, is not
      one that could with any likelihood of success be attributed to the
      narrator.

    <p>
      If any student of good and evil&mdash;the two fruits, alas! grow upon the
      same tree&mdash;would wish for a more startling example of the effect of a
      strong emotion upon certain temperaments than was afforded the people
      present in the Dublin Police Court on the day that Carey left the dock and
      the men he was about to betray to the gallows, that student would indeed
      be exacting.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had been told by a constabulary officer what was coming, so that, unlike
      most persons in the court, I was not too startled to be able to observe
      every detail of the scene. Carey was talking to a brother ruffian named
      Brady quite unconcernedly, and Brady was actually smiling, when an officer
      of constabulary raised his finger and the informer stepped out of the
      dock, and two policemen in plain clothes moved to his side. Carey glanced
      back at his doomed accomplices, and muttered some words to Brady. I did
      not quite catch them, but I thought the words were, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s half an hour
      ahead of you that I am, Joe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Brady simply looked at his betrayer, whom it seems he had been anxious to
      betray. There was absolutely no expression upon his face. Some of the
      others of the same murderous gang seemed equally unaffected. One of them
      turned and spat on the floor. But upon the faces of at least two of the
      men there was a look of malignity that transformed them into fiends. It
      was the look that accompanies the stab of the assassin. Another of them
      gave a laugh, and said something to the man nearest to him; but the laugh
      was not responded to.
    </p>
    <p>
      The youngest of the gang stared at one of the windows of the court-house
      in a way that showed me he had not been able to grasp the meaning of
      Carey&rsquo;s removal from the dock.
    </p>
    <p>
      In half-an-hour every expression worn by the faces of the men had changed.
      They all had a look that might almost have been regarded as jocular. There
      can be no doubt that when a man realises that he has been sentenced to
      death, his first feeling is one of relief. His suspense is over&mdash;so
      much is certain. He feels that&mdash;and that only&mdash;for an hour or
      so. I could see no change on the faces of these poor wretches whom the
      Mephistophelian fun of Fate had induced to call themselves Invincible, in
      order that no devilish element might be wanting in the tragedy of the
      Phoenix Park.

    <p>
      I do not suppose that many persons are acquainted with the secret history
      of the detection of the &ldquo;Invincibles.&rdquo; I think I am right in stating that
      it has never yet been made public. I am not at liberty to mention the
      source whence I derived my knowledge of some of the circumstances that led
      to the arrest of Carey, but there is no doubt in my mind as to the
      accuracy of my &ldquo;information received&rdquo; on this matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      It may, perhaps, be remembered that, some months after the date of the
      murders, a strange advertisement appeared in almost every newspaper in
      Great Britain. It stated that if the man who had told another, on the
      afternoon of May 6th, 1882, that he had once enjoyed a day&rsquo;s skating on
      the pond at the Viceregal Lodge, would communicate with the Chief of the
      Detective Department at Dublin Castle, he would be thanked. Now beyond the
      fact that May 6th was the date of the murders, and that they had taken
      place in the Phoenix Park, there was nothing in this advertisement to
      suggest that it had any bearing upon the shocking incident; still there
      was a general feeling that it had a very intimate connection with the
      efforts that the police were making to unravel the mystery of the outrage;
      and this impression was well founded.
    </p>
    <p>
      I learned that the strangely-worded advertisement had been inserted in the
      newspapers at the instigation of a constabulary officer, who had, in many
      disguises, been endeavouring to find some clue to the assassins in Dublin.
      One evening he slouched into a public-house bespattered as a bricklayer,
      and took a seat in a box, facing a pint of stout. He had been in
      public-house after public-house every Saturday night for several weeks
      without obtaining the slightest suggestion as to the identity of the
      murderers, and he was becoming discouraged; but on this particular evening
      he had his reward, for he overheard a man in the next box telling some
      others, who were drinking with him, that Lord Spencer was not such a bad
      sort of man as might be supposed from the mere fact of his being
      Lord-Lieutenant. He (the narrator) had been told by a man in the Phoenix
      Park on the very evening of the murders that he (the man) had not been
      ashamed to cheer Lord Spencer on his arrival at Dublin that day, for when
      he had last been in Dublin he had allowed him to skate upon the pond in
      the Viceregal grounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      The officer dared not stir from his place: he knew that if he were at all
      suspected of being a detective, his life would not be worth five minutes&rsquo; 
      purchase. He could only hope to catch a glimpse of some of the party when
      they were leaving the place. He failed to do so, for some cause&mdash;I
      cannot remember what it was&mdash;nor could the barmaid give any
      satisfactory reply to his cautiously casual enquiries as to the names of
      any of the men who had occupied the box.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was then that the advertisement was inserted in the various newspapers;
      and, after the lapse of some weeks, a man presented himself to the Chief
      of the Criminal Investigation Department, saying that he believed the
      advertisement referred to him. The man seemed a respectable artisan, and
      his story was that one day during the last winter that Earl Spencer had
      been in Ireland, he (the man) had left his work in order to have a few
      hours&rsquo; skating on the ponds attached to the Zoological Gardens in the
      Phoenix Park, but on arriving at the ponds he found that the ice had been
      broken. &ldquo;I was just going away,&rdquo; the man said, &ldquo;when a gentleman with a
      long beard spoke to me, and enquired if I had had a good skate. I told him
      that I was greatly disappointed, as the ice had all been broken, and I
      would lose my day&rsquo;s pay. He took a card out of his pocket, and wrote
      something on it,&rdquo; continued the man, &ldquo;and then handed it to me, saying,
      &lsquo;Give that to the porter at the Viceregal Lodge, and you&rsquo;ll have the best
      day&rsquo;s skating you have had in all your life.&rsquo; He said what was true: I
      handed in the card and told the porter that a tall gentleman with a beard
      had given it to me. &lsquo;That was His Excellency himself,&rsquo; said the porter, as
      he brought me down to the pond, where, sure enough, I had such a day&rsquo;s
      skating as I&rsquo;ve never had before or since.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you were in the Phoenix Park on the evening of the murders?&rdquo; said the
      Chief of the Department.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must have been there within half-an-hour of the time they were
      committed,&rdquo; replied the man. &ldquo;But I know nothing of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m convinced of it,&rdquo; said the officer. &ldquo;But I should like to hear if you
      met any one you knew in the Park as you were coming away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I only met one man whose name I knew,&rdquo; said the other, &ldquo;and that was a
      builder that I have done some jobs for: James Carey is his name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was precisely the one bit of evidence that was required for the
      committal of Carey.
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour afterwards he offered to turn Queen&rsquo;s Evidence.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HERE is plenty of
      light as well as gloom to be found in the law courts, especially in
      Ireland. Until recently, the Irish Bench included many humorists. Perhaps
      the last of the race was Mr. Baron Dowse. Reporters were constantly giving
      me accounts of the brilliant sallies of this judge; but I must confess it
      seemed to me that most of the examples which I heard were susceptible of
      being regarded as evidence of the judge&rsquo;s good memory rather than of his
      original powers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon one occasion, he complained of the misprints in newspapers, and
      stated that some time before, he had made the quotation in court, &ldquo;Better
      fifty years of Europe than a cycle of Cathay,&rdquo; but the report of the case
      in the newspaper attributed to him the statement, &ldquo;Better fifty years of
      Europe than a circus at Bombay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He omitted giving the name of the paper that had so ill-treated him and
      Lord Tennyson. He had not been a judge for fifteen years without becoming
      acquainted with the rudiments of story-telling.

    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Justice Lawson was another Irish judge with a strong vein of humour
      which he sometimes repressed, for I do not think that he took any great
      pleasure in listening to that hearty, spontaneous, and genial outburst of
      laughter that greets every attempt at humour on the part of a judge. It is
      a nasty thing to say, but I do believe that he now and again doubted the
      sincerity of the appreciation of even the junior counsel. A reporter who
      was present at one Cork Assizes when Lawson was at his best, told me a
      story of his charge to a jury which conveys a very good idea of what his
      style of humour was.
    </p>
    <p>
      A man was indicted for stealing a pig&mdash;an animal common in some parts
      of Ireland. He was found driving it along, with no more than the normal
      amount of difficulty which such an operation involves; and on being spoken
      to by the sergeant of constabulary, he stated that he had bought the pig
      in a neighbouring town, and that he had paid a certain specified sum for
      it. On the same evening, however, a report reached the police barrack that
      a pig, the description of which corresponded with the recollection which
      the sergeant retained of the one which he had seen some hours before, had
      been stolen from its home in the neighbourhood. The owner was brought face
      to face with the animal that the sergeant had met, and it was identified
      as the one that had been stolen. The man in whose possession the pig was
      found was again very frank in stating where he had bought it; but his
      second account of the transaction was not on all fours with his first, and
      the person from whom he said he had purchased it, denied all knowledge of
      the sale&mdash;in fact, he was able to show that he was at Waterford at
      the time he was alleged to be disposing of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      All these facts were clearly proved; and no attempt was made to controvert
      them in the defence. The counsel for the prisoner admitted that the police
      had a good <i>prima facie</i> case for the arrest of his client; there
      were, undoubtedly, some grounds for suspecting that the animal had
      disappeared from the custody of its owner through the instrumentality of
      the prisoner; but he felt sure that when the jury had heard the witnesses
      for the defence, they would admit that it was utterly impossible to
      conceive the notion that he had had anything whatever to do with the
      matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The parish priest was the first witness called, and he stated that he had
      known the prisoner for several years, and had always regarded him as a
      thrifty, sober, hard-working man, adding that he was most regular in his
      attendance to his religious duties. Then the episcopal clergyman was
      examined, and stated that the prisoner was an excellent father and a
      capital gardener; he also knew something about the care of poultry.
      Several of the prisoner&rsquo;s neighbours testified to his respectability and
      his readiness to oblige them, even at considerable personal inconvenience.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the usual speeches, the judge summed up as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen of the jury, you have heard the evidence in the case, and it&rsquo;s
      not for me to say that any of it is false. The police sergeant met the
      prisoner driving the stolen pig, and the prisoner gave two different
      accounts as to how it had come into his possession, but neither of these
      accounts could be said to have a particle of truth in it. On the other
      hand, however, you have heard the evidence of the two clergymen, to whom
      the prisoner was well known. Nothing could be more satisfactory than the
      character they gave him. Then you heard the evidence given by the
      neighbours of the prisoner, and I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll agree with me that nothing
      could be more gratifying than the way they all spoke of his neighbourly
      qualities. Now, gentlemen, although no attempt whatever has been made by
      the defence to meet the evidence given for the prosecution, yet I feel it
      necessary to say that it is utterly impossible that you should ignore the
      testimony given as to the character of the prisoner by so many witnesses
      of unimpeachable integrity; therefore, gentlemen, I think that the only
      conclusion you can come to is that the pig was stolen by the prisoner and
      that he is the most amiable man in the County Cork.&rdquo;

      Mr. Justice Lawson used to boast that he was the only judge on the Bench
      who had ever arrested a man with his own hand. The circumstances connected
      with this remarkable incident were related to me by a reporter who was
      present in the court when the judge made the arrest.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>locale</i> was the court-house of an assize town in the South of
      Ireland. For several days the Crown had failed to obtain a conviction,
      although in the majority of the cases the evidence was practically
      conclusive; and as each prisoner was either sent back or set free, the
      crowds of sympathisers made an uproar that all the ushers in attendance
      were powerless to suppress. On the fourth day the judge, at the opening of
      the court, called for the County Inspector of Constabulary, and, when the
      officer was brought from the billiard-room of the club, and bustled in,
      all sabre and salute, the judge, in his quiet way, remarked to him, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
      sorry for troubling you, sir, but I just wished to say that as the court
      has been turned into a bear-garden for some hours during the past three
      days, I intend to hold you responsible for the maintenance of perfect
      order to-day. Your duty is to arrest every man, woman, or child that makes
      any demonstration of satisfaction or dissatisfaction at the result of the
      hearing of a case, and to put them in the dock, and give evidence as to
      their contempt of court. I&rsquo;ll deal with them after that.&rdquo; The officer went
      down, and orders were given to his men, of whom there were about fifty in
      the court, to arrest any one expressing his feelings. The first prisoner
      to be tried was a man named O&rsquo;Halloran, and his case excited a great deal
      of interest. The court was crowded to a point of suffocation while the
      judge was summing up, which he did with a directness that left nothing to
      be desired. In five minutes the jury had returned a verdict of &ldquo;Not
      Guilty.&rdquo; At that instant a wild &ldquo;Hurroo!&rdquo; rang through the court. It came
      from a youth who had climbed a pillar at a distance of about a yard from
      the Bench. In a moment the judge had put out his hand and grasped the
      fellow by the collar; and then, of course, the policemen crushed through
      the crowd, and about a dozen of them seized the prehensible legs of the
      prisoner Stylites.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One of you will be ample,&rdquo; said the judge. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t pull the boy to pieces;
      let him down gently.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This operation was carried out, and the excitable youth was placed in the
      dock, whence the prisoner just tried had stepped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said the judge, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to make an example of you. You heard
      what I said to the Inspector of Constabulary, and yet I arrested you with
      my own hand in the very act of committing a gross contempt of court. I&rsquo;ll
      make an example of you for the benefit of others. What&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O&rsquo;Halloran, yer honour,&rdquo; said the trembling youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that the name of the prisoner who has just been tried?&rdquo; said the
      judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is, my lord,&rdquo; replied the registrar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is the last prisoner any relation of yours?&rdquo; the judge asked of the youth
      in the dock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s me brother, yer honour,&rdquo; was the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Release the boy, and go on with the business of the court,&rdquo; said the
      judge.

      I chanced to be in Belfast at the time of the riots in 1886, and my
      experience of the incidents of every day and every night led me to believe
      that British troops have been engaged in some campaigns that were a good
      deal less risky to war correspondents than the riots were to the local
      newspaper reporters. Six of them were more or less severely wounded in the
      course of a week. I found it necessary, more than once, to go through the
      localities of the disturbances, and I must confess that I was always glad
      when I found myself out of the line of fire. I am strongly of the opinion
      that the reporters should have been paid at the ratio of war
      correspondents at that time. When they engaged themselves they could not
      have contemplated the possibility of being forced daily for several weeks
      to stand up before a fusilade of stones weighing a pound or so each, and
      Martini-Henry bullets, with an occasional iron &ldquo;nut&rdquo; thrown in to make up
      weight, as it were. In the words of the estate agents&rsquo; advertisements,
      there was a great deal of &ldquo;good mixed shooting&rdquo; in the streets almost
      nightly for a month.
    </p>
    <p>
      Several ludicrous incidents took place while the town was crowded with
      constabulary who had been brought hastily from the country districts. A
      reporter told me that he was the witness of an earnest remonstrance on the
      part of a young policeman with a tram-car driver, whom he advised to take
      his &ldquo;waggon&rdquo; down some of the side streets, in order to escape the angry
      crowd that had assembled farther up the road. Upon another occasion, a
      grocer&rsquo;s shop had been looted by the mob at night, and a man had been
      fortunate enough to secure a fine ham which he was endeavouring, but with
      very partial success, to secrete beneath his coat. A whole ham takes a
      good deal of secreting. The police had orders to clear the street, and
      they were endeavouring to obey these orders. The man with the ham received
      a push on his shoulder, and the policeman by whom it was dealt, shouted
      out in a fine, rich Southern brogue (abhorred in Belfast), &ldquo;Git along wid
      ye, now thin, you and yer violin. Is this any toime for ye to be after
      lookin&rsquo; to foind an awjence? Ye&rsquo;ll get that violin broke, so ye will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man was only too glad to hurry on with his &ldquo;Strad.&rdquo; of fifteen pounds&rsquo; 
      weight, mild-cured. He did not wait to explain that there is a difference
      between the viol and &ldquo;loot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>

      One of the country policemen made an arrest of a man whom he saw in the
      act of throwing a stone, and the next day he gave his evidence at the
      Police Court very clearly. He had ascertained that the scene of the arrest
      was York Street, and he said so; but the street is about a mile long, and
      the magistrate wished to know at what part of it the incident had
      occurred.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was just outside the cimitery, yer wash&rsquo;p,&rdquo; replied the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The cemetery?&rdquo; said the magistrate. &ldquo;But there&rsquo;s no cemetery in York
      Street.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, yer wash&rsquo;p&mdash;there&rsquo;s a foine cimitery there,&rdquo; said the
      policeman. &ldquo;It was was just outside the cimitery I arrested the prisoner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the first I&rsquo;ve heard of a cemetery in that neighbourhood,&rdquo; said the
      Bench. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think the constable is mistaken, sergeant?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sergeant put a few questions to the witness, and asked him how he knew
      that the place was a cemetery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, how would anybody know a cimitery except by the tombstones?&rdquo; said
      the witness. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t go for to dig up a corp or two, but there was the
      foinest array of tombstones I ever clapt oyes on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the stonecutter&rsquo;s yard the man means,&rdquo; came a voice from the body of
      the court; and in another moment there was a roar of laughter from all
      present.
    </p>
    <p>
      The arrest had been made outside a stonecutter&rsquo;s railed yard, and the
      strange policeman had taken the numerous specimens of the proprietor&rsquo;s
      craft, which were standing around in various stages of progress, for the
      <i>bona fide</i> furnishing of a graveyard.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was scarcely to be blamed for his error.

      now pretty well known, I think&mdash;of the man who had caught a
      policeman, and was holding his head down while he battered him, when a
      brother rowdy rushed up, crying,&mdash;

    <p>
      &ldquo;Who have you there, Bill?&rdquo;
     </p>

      &ldquo;A policeman.&rdquo;

      &ldquo;Hold on, and let me have a thump at him.&rdquo;

      Having referred to the Royal Irish Constabulary, I may not perhaps be
      regarded as more than usually discursive if I add my expression of
      admiration for this splendid Force to the many pages of commendation which
      it has received from time to time from those whose opinion carries weight
      with it&mdash;which mine does not. The men are the flower of the people of
      Ireland. They have a <i>sense</i> of discipline&mdash;it has not to be
      impressed upon them by an occasional &ldquo;fortnight&rsquo;s C.B.&rdquo; Upon one occasion,
      I was the witness of the extent to which this innate sense of discipline
      will stretch without the breaking strain being reached. One of the most
      distinguished officers in the Force was parading about one hundred men
      armed with the usual carbine&mdash;the handiest of weapons&mdash;and with
      swords fixed. He was mounted on a charger with some blood in it&mdash;you
      would not find the same man astride of anything else&mdash;and for several
      days it had been looking down the muzzles of the rifles of a couple of
      regiments of autumn manoeuvrers who had been engaged in a sham fight in
      the Park; but it had never shown the least uneasiness, even when the Field
      Artillery set about the congenial task of annihilating a skeleton enemy.
      It stood patiently while the constabulary &ldquo;ported,&rdquo; &ldquo;carried,&rdquo; and
      &ldquo;shouldered&rdquo;; but so soon as the order to &ldquo;present&rdquo; was given, a gleam of
      sunlight glanced down the long line of fixed swords, and that twinkle was
      just what an Irish charger, born and bred among the fogs of the Atlantic
      seaboard, could not stand. It whirled round, and went at full gallop
      across the springy turf, then suddenly stopped, sending its rider about
      twenty yards ahead upon his hands and knees. After this feat, it allowed
      itself to be quietly captured by the mounted orderly who had galloped
      after it. The orderly dismounted from his horse, and passed it on to the
      officer, who galloped back to the long line of men standing at the
      &ldquo;present&rdquo; just as they had been before he had left them so hurriedly. They
      received the order to &ldquo;shoulder&rdquo; without emotion, and then the parade went
      on as if nothing had happened. Subsequently, the officer remounted his own
      charger&mdash;which had been led up, and had offered an ample apology&mdash;and
      in course of time he again gave the order to &ldquo;present.&rdquo; The horse&rsquo;s ears
      went back, but it did not move a hoof. After the &ldquo;shoulder&rdquo; and &ldquo;port&rdquo; the
      officer made the men &ldquo;charge swords,&rdquo; and did not halt them until they
      were within a yard of the horse&rsquo;s head. The manouvre had no effect upon
      the animal.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could not help contrasting the discipline shown by the Irish
      Constabulary upon this occasion with the bearing of a company of a
      regiment of German Infantry, who were being paraded in the Thiergarten at
      Berlin, when I was riding there one day. The captain and lieutenant had
      strolled away from the men, leaving them standing, not &ldquo;at ease,&rdquo; but at
      &ldquo;attention&rdquo;&mdash;I think the officers were making sure that the carriage
      of the Crown Prince was not coming in their direction. But before two
      minutes had passed the men were standing as easy as could well be,
      chatting together, and suggesting that the officers were awaiting the
      approach of certain young ladies, about whose personal traits and whose
      profession they were by no means reticent. Of course, when the officers
      turned, the men stood at &ldquo;attention&rdquo;; but I trotted on to where I lived In
      Den Zelten, feeling that there was but little sense of discipline in the
      German Army&mdash;so readily does a young man arrive at a grossly
      erroneous conclusion through generalising from a single instance.

      It is difficult to understand how it comes that the splendid services of
      the Royal Irish Constabulary have not been recognised by the State. I have
      known officers who served on the staff during the Egyptian campaign, but
      who confessed to me that they never heard a shot fired except for saluting
      purposes, and yet they wore three decorations for this campaign. Surely
      those Irish Constabulary officers, who have discharged the most perilous
      duties from time to time, as well as daily duties requiring the exercise
      of tact, discretion, judgment, and patience, are at least as deserving of
      a medal as those soldiers who obtained the maximum of reward at the
      minimum of risk in Egypt, South Africa, or Ashantee. The decoration of the
      Volunteers was a graceful recognition of the spirit that binds together
      these citizen soldiers. Surely the services of some members of the Irish
      Constabulary should be similarly recognised. This is a genuine Irish
      grievance, and it is one that could be redressed much more easily than the
      majority of the ills that the Irish people are heir to. A vote for a
      thousand pounds would purchase the requisite number of medals or stars or
      crosses&mdash;perhaps all three might be provided out of such a fund&mdash;for
      those members of the Force who have distinguished themselves. The right
      adjudication of the rewards presents no difficulty, owing to the &ldquo;record&rdquo;
       system which prevails in the Force.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>HEN writing for an
      Irish newspaper, I took some pains to point out how easily the country
      might be made attractive to tourists if only the hotels were improved. I
      have had frequent &ldquo;innings,&rdquo; and my experiences of Irish hotels in various
      districts where I have shot, or fished, or yachted, or boated, would make
      a pretty thick volume, if recorded. But while most of these experiences
      have some grain of humour in them, that humour is of a type that looks
      best when viewed from a distance. When it is first sprung upon him, this
      Irish fun is not invariably relished by the traveller.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Max O&rsquo;Rell told me that he liked the Irish hotels at which he had
      sojourned, because he was acknowledged by the <i>maîtres</i> to possess an
      identity that could not be adequately expressed by numerals. But on the
      whole it is my impression that the numerical system is quite tolerable if
      one gets good food and a clean sleeping-place. To be sure there is no
      humour in a comfortable dinner, or a bed that does not require a layer of
      Keating to be spread as a sedative to the army of occupation; still,
      though the story of tough chickens and midnight hunts can be made
      genuinely entertaining, I have never found that these actual incidents
      were in themselves very inspiriting.
    </p>
    <p>
      A friend of mine who has a capital shooting in a picturesque district, was
      compelled to lodge, and to ask his guests to lodge, at the little inn
      during his first shooting season. Knowing that the appetite of men who
      have been walking over mountains of heather is not usually very
      fastidious, he fancied that the inn cook would be quite equal to the
      moderate demands made upon her skill. The experiment was a disastrous one.
      The more explicit the instructions the woman was given regarding the
      preparation of the game, the more mortifying to the flesh were her
      achievements. There was, it is true, a certain amount of interest aroused
      among us every day as to the form that the culinary whim of the cook would
      assume. The monarch that offered a reward for the discovery of a new
      sensation would have had a good time with us. We had new sensations at the
      dinner hour every day. &ldquo;Lord, we know what we are, but know not what we
      may be,&rdquo; was an apothegm that found constant illustration when applied to
      that woman&rsquo;s methods: we knew that we gave her salmon, and grouse, and
      hare, and snipe; but what was served to us, Heaven and that cook only knew&mdash;on
      second thoughts I will leave Heaven out of the question altogether. The
      monstrous originalities, the appalling novelties, the confounding of
      substances, the unnatural daring manifested in every day&rsquo;s dinner, filled
      us with amazement, but, alas! with nothing else. We were living in a sort
      of perpetual kitchen blizzard&mdash;in the centre of a culinary chaos. The
      whirl was too much for us.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our host took upon him to allay the fiend. He sent to the nearest town for
      butcher&rsquo;s supplies. The first joint that arrived was a fine piece of
      corned beef.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, my good woman,&rdquo; cried our host, putting it into the cook&rsquo;s hands,
      &ldquo;I suppose you can cook that, if you can&rsquo;t cook game.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, your honour, it&rsquo;s misself that can cook it tubbe sure,&rdquo; she
      cried in her lighthearted way.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did cook it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>She roasted it for five hours on a spit in front of the kitchen fire.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      As she laid it on the table, she apologised for the unavoidable absence of
      gravy.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the driest joint she had ever roasted, she said; and I do believe
      that it was.

      One of the party, who had theories on the higher education of women, and
      other methods of increasing the percentage of unmarriageable females, said
      that the cook had never been properly approached. She could not be
      expected to know by intuition that the flavour of salmon trout was
      impaired by being stewed in a cauldron with a hare and many friends, or
      that the prejudices of an effete civilisation did not extend so far as to
      make the boiling of grouse in a pot with bacon a necessity of existence.
      The woman only needed a hint or two and she would be all right.
    </p>
    <p>
      He said he would give her a hint or two. He made soup the basis of his
      first hints.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was so simple, he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He picked up a couple of hares, an old cock grouse and a few snipe, and
      told the woman to put them in a pot, cover them with water, and leave them
      to simmer&mdash;&ldquo;Not to boil, mind; you understand?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Oh, tubbe
      sure, sorr,&rdquo;&mdash;for the six hours that we would be on the mountain. He
      showed her how to cut up onions, and they cut up some between them; he
      then taught her how to fry an onion in the most delicate of ribbon-like
      slices for &ldquo;browning.&rdquo; All were added to the pot, and our friend joined us
      with a very red face, and carrying about him a flavour of fried onions as
      well defined as a saint&rsquo;s halo by Fra Angelico. The dogs sniffed at him
      for a while, and so did the keeper.
    </p>
    <p>
      He declared that the woman was a most intelligent specimen, and quite
      ready to learn. We smiled grimly.
    </p>
    <p>
      All that day our friend shot nothing. We could see that, like Eugene Aram,
      his thought was otherwhere. We knew that he was thinking over the coming
      soup.
    </p>
    <p>
      On returning to the inn after a seven hours&rsquo; tramp, he hastened to the
      kitchen. A couple of us loitered outside the door, for we felt certain
      that a surprise was awaiting our friend&mdash;the pot would have leaked,
      perhaps; but the savoury smell that filled the kitchen and overflowed into
      the lobby and the room where we dined made us aware that everything was
      right.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our friend turned a stork&rsquo;s eye into the pot, and then, with a word of
      kind commendation to the cook&mdash;&ldquo;A man&rsquo;s word of encouragement is
      everything to a woman, my lad, with a wink to me&mdash;he called for a
      pint of port wine and placed it handy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said he to the woman, &ldquo;strain off that soup in a quarter of an
      hour, add that wine, and we&rsquo;ll show these gentlemen that between us we can
      cook.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In a quarter of an hour we were sitting round the table. Our friend tried
      to look modest and devoid of all self-consciousness as the woman entered
      with a glow of crimson triumph on her face, and bearing in her hands an
      immense dish with the well-known battered zinc cover concealing the
      contents.
    </p>
    <p>
      Down went the dish, and up went the cover, disclosing a rugged,
      mountainous heap of the bones of hare, with threads of flesh still
      adhering to them, and the skeletons of some birds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Lord!&rdquo; cried our host. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s this anyway? The rags of what was
      stewed down for the soup?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Our theorising friend leapt up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Woman,&rdquo; he shouted, &ldquo;where the devil is the soup?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure, didn&rsquo;t ye bid me strain it off, sorr?&rdquo; said the woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And where the blazes did you strain it off?&rdquo; he asked, in an awful
      whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, where should I be after straining it, sorr, but into the bog?&rdquo; she
      replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bog was an incident of the landscape at the back of the inn.

      I recollect that upon the occasion of this shooting party, a new
      under-keeper arrived from Connaught, and I overheard him telling a
      colleague who came from the county Clare, that the avenue leading to his
      last employer&rsquo;s residence was forty-two miles long.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By me sowl,&rdquo; said the Clare man, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not me that would like to be set
      down at the lodge gates on an empty stomach within half-an-hour of
      dinner-time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After some further conversation, the Connaught man began to dilate upon
      the splendour of his late master&rsquo;s family. He reached a truly dramatic
      climax by saying,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And every night of their lives at home the ladies strip for dinner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Holy Moses!&rdquo; was the comment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do your master&rsquo;s people at home strip for dinner?&rdquo; enquired the Connaught
      man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; but they link in,&rdquo; was the thoughtful reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes, it must be acknowledged, an unreasonable strain is put upon the
      resources of an Irish inn by an inconsiderate tourist. Some years ago, my
      brother-in-law, Bram Stoker, was spending his holiday in a picturesque
      district of the south-west. He put up at the usual inn, and before leaving
      for a ramble, oh the morning of his arrival, the cook (and waitress) asked
      him what he would like for lunch. The day was a trifle chilly, and,
      forgetting for the moment that he was not within the precincts of the
      Green-room or the Garrick, he said, &ldquo;Oh, I think that it&rsquo;s just the day
      for a devil&mdash;yes, I&rsquo;ll cat a devil at two.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Holy Saints!&rdquo; cried the woman, as he walked off. &ldquo;What sort of a man is
      that at all, at all? He wants to lunch off the Ould Gentleman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The landlord scratched his chin and said that this was the most
      unreasonable demand that had ever been made upon his house. He expressed
      the opinion that the gastronome whose palate was equal to this particular
      <i>plat</i> should seek it elsewhere&mdash;he even ventured to specify the
      <i>locale</i> at which the search might appropriately begin with the best
      chances of being realised. His wife, however, took a less despondent view
      of the situation, and suggested that as the powers of exorcising the Foul
      Fiend were delegated to the priest, it might be only reasonable to assume
      that the reverend gentleman would be equal to the much less difficult feat
      involved in the execution of the tourist&rsquo;s order.
    </p>
    <p>
      But before the priest had been sent for, the constabulary officer drove
      up, and was consulted on the question that was agitating the household.
      With a roar of laughter, the officer called for a couple of chops and the
      mustard and cayenne pots&mdash;he had been there before&mdash;and showed
      the cook the way out of her difficulty.
    </p>
    <p>
      But up to the present hour I hear that that landlord says,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the powers, it&rsquo;s misself that never knew what a divil was till Mr.
      Stoker came to my house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>

    <hr />
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      However piquant a comestible the Foul Fiend might be, I believe that in
      point of toughness he would compare favourably with a fully-matured swan.
      Among the delicacies of the table I fear that the swan will not obtain
      great honour, if any dependence may be placed upon a story which was told
      to me at a fishing inn in Connemara, regarding an experiment accidentally
      tried upon such a bird. I repeat the story in this place, lest any
      literary man may be led to pamper a weak digestion by indulging in a swan
      supper. The specimen in question was sent by a gentleman, who lived in a
      stately home in Lincolnshire, as a gift to the Athenæum club, of which he
      was a member. The bird was addressed to the secretary, and that gentleman
      without delay handed it over to the cook to be prepared for the table.
      There was to be a special dinner at the end of the week, and the committee
      thought that a distinctive feature might be made of the swan. They were
      not mistaken. As a <i>coup d&rsquo;oil</i> the swan, resting on a great silver
      dish, carried to the table by two servitors, could scarcely have been
      surpassed even by the classical peacock or the mediaeval boar&rsquo;s head. The
      croupier plunged a fork with a steady hand into the right part&mdash;wherever
      that was situated&mdash;and then attacked the breast with his knife. Not
      the slightest impression could he make upon that portion of the mighty
      structure that faced him. The breast turned the edge of the knife; and
      when the breast did that the people at the table began to wonder what the
      drum-sticks would be like. A stronger blade was sent for, and an athlete&mdash;he
      was not a member of the Athenæum&mdash;essayed to penetrate the skin, and
      succeeded too, after a vigorous struggle. When he had wiped the drops from
      his brow he went at the flesh with confidence in his own powers. By some
      brilliant wrist-practice he contrived to chip a few flakes off, but it
      soon became plain that eating any one of them was out of the question. One
      might as well submit as a <i>plat</i> a drawer of a collector&rsquo;s geological
      cabinet. The club cook was sent for, and he explained that he had had no
      previous experience of swans, but he considered that the thirteen hours&rsquo; 
      boiling to which he had submitted the first specimen that had come under
      his notice, all that could reasonably be required by any bird, whether
      swan or cassowary. He thought that perhaps with a circular saw, after a
      steam roller had been passed a few times over the carcass, it might be
      possible....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I hope you got my swan all right,&rdquo; said the donor a few days after,
      addressing the secretary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was a nice joke you played on us,&rdquo; said the secretary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Joke? What do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As if you didn&rsquo;t know! We had the thing boiled for thirteen hours, and
      yet when it was brought to the table we might as well have tried to cut
      through the Rock of Gibraltar with a pocket-knife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean? You don&rsquo;t mean to say that you had it cooked?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you send it to be cooked?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cooked! cooked! Great heavens, man! I sent it to be stuffed and preserved
      as a curiosity in the club. That swan has been in my family for two
      hundred and eighty years. It was one of the identical birds fed by the
      children of Charles I.&mdash;you&rsquo;ve seen the picture of it. My ancestor
      held the post of &lsquo;master of the swans and keeper of the king&rsquo;s cygnets
      sure.&rsquo; It is said that a swan will live for three hundred years or
      thereabouts. And you plucked it, and cooked it! Great heavens! It was a
      bit tough, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tough?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I daresay you&rsquo;d be tough, too, about a.d. 2200. And I thought it
      would look so well in the hall!&rdquo;
     </p>

    <p>
      At the same time that the tale just recorded was told to me, I heard
      another Lincolnshire story. I do not suppose that it is new. A certain
      church was situated at a place that was within the sphere of influence of
      some fens when in flood. The consequence was that during a severe winter,
      divine service was held only every second Sunday. Once, however, the
      weather was so bad that the parson did not think it worth his while going
      near the church for five Sundays. This fact came to the ears of the
      Bishop, and he wrote for an explanation. The clergyman replied as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your lordship has been quite correctly informed regarding the length of
      the interval that has elapsed since my church was open; but the fact is
      that the devil himself couldn&rsquo;t get at my parishioners in the winter, and
      I promise your lordship to be before him in the spring.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      That parson took a humbler view of his position and privileges in the
      world than did a Presbyterian minister in Ulster whose pompous way of
      moving and of speaking drew toward him many admirers and imitators. He
      paid a visit to Palestine at one time of his life, and on his return, he
      preached a sermon introducing some of his experiences. Now, the only
      inhabitants of the Holy Land that the majority of travellers can talk
      about are the fleas; but this Presbyterian minister had much to tell about
      all that he had seen. It was, however, only when he began to show his
      flock how strictly the inspiriting prophecies of Jeremiah and Joel and the
      rest had been fulfilled that he proved that he had not visited the country
      in vain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear friends,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I read in the Sacred Book the prophecy that
      the land should be in heaps: I looked up from the page, and there, before
      my eyes, were the heaps. I read that the bittern should cry there: I
      looked up; lo! close at hand stood a bittern. I read that the Minister of
      the Lord should mourn there: <i>I was that minister.</i>&rdquo;

    <p>
      Upon one occasion, when sojourning at a picturesquely situated Connemara
      inn, hot water was left outside my bedroom door in a handy soup tureen, in
      which there was also a ladle reposing. One morning in the same &ldquo;hotel&rdquo; I
      called the attention of the official, who discharged (indifferently) the
      duties of boots and landlord, to the circumstance that my bath
      (recollecting the advertisement of the entertainment which it was possible
      to obtain under certain conditions at the Norwegian inn, I had brought the
      bath with me) had not been emptied since the previous day. The man said,
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s right that you are, sorr,&rdquo; and forthwith remedied the omission by
      throwing the contents of the bath out of the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was so struck by the convenience of this system of main drainage, and it
      seemed so simple, that the next morning, finding that the bath was in the
      same condition as before, I thought to save trouble by performing the
      landlord&rsquo;s operation for myself. I opened the window and tilted over the
      bath. In a moment there was a yell from below, and the air became
      sulphurous with Celtic maledictions. These were followed by roars of
      laughter in the vernacular, so that I thought it prudent to lower both the
      window and the blind without delay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Holy Biddy!&rdquo; remarked the landlord when I had descended to breakfast&mdash;not
      failing to observe that a portly figure was standing in a <i>semi-nude</i>
      condition in front of the kitchen fire, while on the back of a chair
      beside him a black coat was spread-eagled, sending forth a cloud of steam&mdash;&ldquo;Holy
      Biddy, sorr, what was that ye did this morning, anyway?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean, Dennis?&rdquo; I asked innocently. &ldquo;I shaved and dressed as
      usual.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye emptied the tin tub [<i>i.e</i>., my zinc bath] out of the windy over
      Father Conn,&rdquo; replied the landlord. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s himself that&rsquo;s being dried this
      minute before the kitchen fire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very sorry,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;You see, I fancied from the way you emptied the
      bath yesterday that that was the usual way of doing the business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So it is, sorr,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;But you should always be after looking out
      first to see that all&rsquo;s clear below.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you have those directions printed and hung up in the bedroom?&rdquo;
       said I, assuming&mdash;as I have always found it safe to do upon such
      occasions&mdash;the aggressive tone of the injured party.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have so many gentlemen coming here that&rsquo;s so dirty that they
      need to be washed down every blessed marnin&rsquo;,&rdquo; he replied; and I thought
      it better to draw upon my newspaper experience, and quote the
      three-starred admonition, &ldquo;All communications on this subject must now
      cease.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      However, the trout which were laid on the table in front of me were so
      numerous, and looked so tempting, that I went into the kitchen, and after
      making an elaborate apology to Father Conn, the amiable parish priest, for
      the mishap he had sustained through my ignorance of the natural
      precautions necessary to be taken when preparing my bath, insisted on the
      reverend gentleman&rsquo;s joining me at breakfast while his coat was being
      dried.
    </p>
    <p>
      With only a superficial reluctance, he accepted my invitation, remarking,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had my own breakfast a couple of hours ago, sir, but in troth I feel
      quite hungry again. Faith, it&rsquo;s true enough that there&rsquo;s nothing like a
      morning swim for giving a man an appetite.&rdquo;

      Two lady relatives of mine were on their way to a country house in the
      county Galway, and were compelled to stay for a night at the inn, which
      was a sort of half-way house between the railway station and their
      destination. On being shown to their bedroom while their dinner was being
      made ready, they naturally wished to remove from their faces the traces of
      their dusty drive of sixteen miles, so one of them bent over the banisters&mdash;there
      was no bell in the room, of course&mdash;and inquired if the servant would
      be good enough to carry upstairs some hot water.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely, miss,&rdquo; the servant responded from below.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few minutes, the door of the bedroom was knocked at, and the woman
      entered, bearing in her hand a tray with two glasses, a saucer of loaf
      sugar, a lemon, a ladle, and a small jug of hot water.
    </p>
    <p>
      It appeared that in this district the use of hot water is unknown except
      as an accompaniment to whisky, a lemon, and a lump of sugar. The
      combination of the four is said to be both palatable and popular.

      It was at a much larger and more pretentious establishment in the
      south-west that I was staying when a box of books arrived for me from the
      library of Messrs. Eason &amp; Son. It was tied with stout, tough cord,
      about as thick as one&rsquo;s little finger. I was in the act of dressing when
      the boots brought up the box, so I asked him to open it for me. The man
      fumbled for some time at the knot, and at last he said he would have to
      cut the cord.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I had rubbed the soap out of my eyes,
    </p>
    <p>
      I noticed him in the act of sawing through the tough cord with one of my
      razors which I had laid on the dressing-table after shaving.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop, stop,&rdquo; I shouted. &ldquo;Man, do you know that that&rsquo;s a razor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;ll do well enough for this, sir. I&rsquo;ve forgot my knife downstairs,&rdquo;
       said the man complacently.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the razor did for the operation, the operation certainly did for the
      razor.

      And here I am led to recall a story told to me by the late Dr. George
      Crowe, the husband of Miss Bateman, the distinguished actress, and brother
      to Mr. Eyre Crowe, A.R.A. It will be remembered by all who are familiar
      with the chief incidents in the life of Thackeray, that in 1853 he adopted
      Miss Amy Crowe (her father, an historian and journalist of eminence in his
      day, had been one of the novelist&rsquo;s closest friends), and she became one
      of the Thackeray household. Her brother George was at school, but he had
      &ldquo;the run of the house,&rdquo; so to speak, in Onslow Square. Next to the desire
      to become an expert smoker, the desire to become an accomplished shaver
      is, I think, the legitimate aspiration of boyhood; and George Crowe had
      his longings in this direction, when examining Thackeray&rsquo;s razors with the
      other contents of his dressing-room one day. The means of gratifying such
      an aspiration are (fortunately) not invariably within the reach of most
      boys, and young Crowe was not exceptionally situated in this matter. The
      same spirit of earnest investigation, however, which had led him to
      discover the razors, caused him to find in one of the garrets an old but
      well-preserved travelling trunk, bound with ox-hide, and studded with
      brass nails. To spread a copious lather over a considerable part of the
      lid, and to set about the removal, by the aid of a razor, of the hair of
      the ox-hide, occupied the boy the greater part of an afternoon. Though not
      exactly so good as the real operation, this shave was, he considered, a
      move in the right direction; and it was certainly better than nothing at
      all. By a singular coincidence, it was about this time that Thackeray
      began to complain of the difficulty of putting an edge upon his razors,
      and to inquire if any one had been at the case where they were kept. Of
      course, no one except the boy knew anything about the business, and he,
      for prudential reasons, preserved silence. The area of the ox-hide that
      still remained hirsute was pretty extensive, and he foresaw many an hour
      of fearful joy, such as he had already tasted in the garret. Twice again
      he lathered and shaved at the ox-hide; but the third attempt was not a
      success, owing to the sudden appearance of the housekeeper, who led the
      boy to the novelist&rsquo;s study and gave evidence against him, submitting as
      proofs the razor, the shaving-brush, and a portion of George Crowe&rsquo;s thumb
      which he had inadvertently sliced off. Thackeray rose from his desk and
      mounted the stairs to the garret; and when the housekeeper followed,
      insisting on the boy&rsquo;s accompanying her&mdash;probably on the French
      principle of confronting a murderer with the body of his victim&mdash;Thackeray
      was found seated on an unshaved portion of the trunk, and roaring with
      laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      So soon as he had recovered, he shook his finger at the delinquent (who,
      twenty-five years afterwards, told me the story), and merely said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;George, I see clearly that in future I&rsquo;ll have to buy my trunks bald.&rdquo;

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>NCE I was treated
      very uncivilly at an hotel in the North of Ireland, and as the occasion
      was one upon which I was, I believed, entitled to be dealt with on terms
      of exceptional courtesy, I felt the slight all the more deeply. The late
      Emperor of Brazil, in yielding to his desire to see everything in the
      world that was worth seeing, had appeared suddenly in Ireland. I had had
      the privilege of taking tiffin with His Majesty aboard a man-of-war at Rio
      Janeiro some years previously, and on calling upon him in London upon the
      occasion of his visit to England, I found to my surprise that he
      remembered the incident. He asked me to go with him to the Giant&rsquo;s
      Causeway, and I promised to do so if he did not insist on starting before
      sunrise,&mdash;he was the earliest riser I ever met. His idea was that we
      could leave Belfast in the morning, travel by rail to Portrush
      (sixty-seven miles distant), drive along the coast to the Giant&rsquo;s Causeway
      (eight miles), and return to Belfast in time to catch the train which left
      for Dublin at three o&rsquo;clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      This programme was actually carried out. On entering the hotel at Portrush&mdash;we
      arrived about eight in the morning&mdash;I hurried to the manager.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have brought the Emperor of Brazil to breakfast,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;so that if
      you could let us have the dining-room to ourselves I should be much
      obliged to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is it that you say you&rsquo;ve brought?&rdquo; asked the manager sleepily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Emperor of Brazil,&rdquo; I replied promptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come now, clear off out of this, you and your jokes,&rdquo; said the manager.
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been taken in before to-day. You&rsquo;ll need to get up earlier in the
      morning if you want to do it again. The Emperor of Brazil indeed! It&rsquo;ll be
      the King of the Cannibal Islands next!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I felt mortified, and so, I fancy, did the manager shortly afterwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      Happily the hotel is now managed by the railway company, and is one of the
      best in all Ireland.

      I fared better in this matter than the messenger who hurried to the
      residence of a painter, who is now a member of the Royal Academy, to
      announce his election as Associate in the days of Sir Francis Grant. It is
      said that the painter felt himself to be so unworthy of the honour which
      was being thrust upon him, that believing that he perceived an attempt on
      the part of some of his brother-artists to make him the victim of a
      practical joke, he promptly kicked the messenger downstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The manager of the hotel did not quite kick me out when I explained to him
      that his house was to be honoured by the presence of an Emperor, but he
      looked as if he would have liked to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      Regarding the early rising of the Emperor Dom Pedro II., several amusing
      anecdotes were in circulation in London upon the occasion of his first
      visit. One morning he had risen, as usual, about four o&rsquo;clock, and was
      taking a stroll through Covent Garden market, when he came face to face
      with three well-known actors, who were returning to their rooms after a
      quiet little supper at the Garrick Club. The Emperor inquired who the
      gentlemen were, and he was told. For years afterwards he was, it is said,
      accustomed to declare that the only men he met in England who seemed to
      believe with him that the early morning was the best part of the day, were
      the actors. The most distinguished members of the profession were, he
      said, in the habit of rising between the hours of three and four every
      morning during the summer.

    <p>
      A story which tends to show that in some directions, at any rate, in
      Ireland the hotel proprietors are by no means wanting in courtesy towards
      distinguished strangers, even when travelling in an unostentatious way,
      was told to me by the late Ciro Pinsuti, the well-known song writer, at
      his house in Mortimer Street. (When he required any changes in the verses
      of mine which he was setting, he invariably anticipated my objections by a
      story, told with admirable effect.) It seems that Pinsuti was induced some
      years before to take a tour to the Killarney Lakes. On arriving at the
      hotel where he had been advised to put up, he found that the house was so
      crowded he had to be content with a sort of china closet, into which a
      sofa-bed had been thrust. The landlord was almost brusque when he ventured
      to protest against the lack of accommodation, but subsequently a
      compromise was effected, and Pinsuti strolled away along the lakes.
    </p>
    <p>
      On returning he found in the hall of the hotel the genial nobleman who was
      Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, and an old London friend of Pinsuti&rsquo;s. He was
      on a visit to the Herberts of Muckross, and attended only by his son and
      one aide-de-camp.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, at one time the same nobleman had been in the habit of contracting
      Pinsuti&rsquo;s name, when addressing him, into &ldquo;Pince&rdquo;; in the course of time
      this became improved into &ldquo;Prince&rdquo;; and for years he was never addressed
      except in this way; so that when he entered the hall of the hotel, His
      Excellency lifted up his hands and cried,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Prince, who on earth would have fancied meeting you here of all
      places in the world?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pinsuti explained that he had merely crossed the Channel for a day or two,
      and that he was staying at the hotel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come along then, and we&rsquo;ll have lunch together,&rdquo; said the Lord
      Lieutenant; and Pinsuti forthwith joined the Viceregal party.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when luncheon was over, and the Viceroy was strolling through the
      grounds for a smoke by the side of the musician, the landlord approached
      His Excellency&rsquo;s son, saying,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your lordship&rsquo;s pardon, but may I ask who the Prince is that
      lunched with you and His Excellency?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What Prince?&rdquo; said Lord Ernest, somewhat puzzled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my lord; I heard His Excellency address him as Prince more than
      once,&rdquo; said the landlord.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Lord Ernest, perceiving the ground for a capital joke, said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, the Prince&mdash;yes, to be sure; I fancied you knew him. Prince!
      yes, that&rsquo;s the Prince of Bohemia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Prince of Bohemia! and I&rsquo;ve sent him to sleep on an iron chair-bed in
      a china closet!&rdquo; cried the landlord.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Ernest looked grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t have done that if I had been you,&rdquo; he said, shaking his head.
      &ldquo;You must try and do better for him than that, my man.&rdquo; Shortly afterwards
      the Viceregal party drove off, and then the landlord approached Pinsuti,
      and bowing to the ground, said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must humbly apologise to your Royal Highness for not having a suitable
      room for your Royal Highness in the morning; but now I&rsquo;m proud to say that
      I have had prepared an apartment which will, I trust, give satisfaction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean by Highnessing me, my good man?&rdquo; asked Pinsuti.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said the landlord, smiling and bowing, &ldquo;though it may please your
      Royal Highness to travel <i>incognito</i>, I trust I know what is due to
      your exalted station, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For the next two days Pinsuti was, he told me, treated with an amount of
      respect such as he had never before experienced. A waiter was specially
      told off to attend to him, and every time he passed the landlord the
      latter bowed in his best style.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was, however, an American lady tourist who held an informal meeting in
      the drawingroom of the hotel, at which it was agreed that no one should be
      seated at the <i>table d&rsquo;hote</i> until the Prince of Bohemia had entered
      and taken his place.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the morning of his departure he found, waiting to take him to the
      railway station, a carriage drawn by four horses. Out to this he passed
      through lines of bowing tourists&mdash;especially Americans.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was all very nice, to be sure,&rdquo; said Pinsuti, in concluding his
      narrative; &ldquo;but the bill I had to pay was not so gratifying. However, one
      cannot be a Prince, even of Bohemia, without paying for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This story more than neutralises, I think, the impression likely to be
      produced by the account of the insolence of the official at the northern
      hotel. Universal civility may be expected even at the largest and
      best-appointed hotels in Ireland.

      As I have somehow drifted into these anecdotes about royal personages, at
      the risk of being considered digressive&mdash;an accusation which I spurn&mdash;I
      must add one curious experience which some relations of mine had of a
      genuine prince. My cousin, Major Wyllie, of the Madras Staff Corps, had
      been attached to the prince&rsquo;s father, who was a certain rajah, and had
      been the instrument employed by the Government for giving him some
      excellent advice as to the course he should adopt if he were desirous of
      getting the Star which it was understood he was coveting. The rajah was
      anxious to have his heir, a boy of twelve, educated in England, and he
      wished to find for him a place in a family where his morals&mdash;the
      rajah was great on morals&mdash;would be properly looked after; so he
      sought the advice of Major Wyllie on this important subject. After some
      correspondence and much persuasion on the part of the potentate, my cousin
      consented to send the youth to his father&rsquo;s house near Edinburgh. The
      rajah was delighted, and promised to have an outfit prepared for his son
      without delay. The result of the consultation which he had with some
      learned members of his <i>entourage</i> on the subject of the costume
      daily worn in Edinburgh by gentlemen, was peculiar. I am of the opinion
      that some of its distinctive features must have been exaggerated, while
      the full value of others cannot have been assigned to them; for the young
      prince submitted himself for the approval of Major Wyllie, and some other
      officers of the Staff, wearing a truly remarkable dress. His boots were of
      the old Hessian pattern, with coloured silk tassels all round the uppers.
      His knees were bare, but just above them the skirt of a kilt flowed, in
      true Scotch fashion, only that the material was not cloth but silk, and
      the colours were not those of any known tartan, but simply a brilliant
      yellow. The coat was of blue velvet, crusted with jewels, and instead of
      the flowing shoulder-pieces, there hung down a rich mantle of gold
      brocade. The crowning incident of this ideal costume of an unobtrusive
      Scotch gentleman whose aim is to pass through the streets without
      attracting attention, was a crimson velvet glengarry cap worn over a white
      turban, and containing three very fine ostrich feathers of different,
      colours, fastened by a diamond aigrette.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, the consensus of opinion among the officers was that the rajah had
      succeeded wonderfully in giving prominence to the chief elements of the
      traditional Scottish national dress, without absolutely extinguishing
      every spark of that orientalism to which the prince had been accustomed.
      It was just the sort of costume that a simple body would like to wear
      daily, walking down Prince&rsquo;s Street, during an inclement winter, they
      said. There was no attempt at ostentation about it; its beauty consisted
      in its almost Puritan simplicity; and there pervaded it a note of that
      sternness which marks the character of the rugged North Briton.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rajah was delighted with this essay of his advisers at making a
      consistent blend of Calicut and Caledonia in <i>modes</i>; but somehow the
      prince arrived in Scotland in a tweed suit.

    </p>

    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      I afterwards heard that on the first morning after the arrival of the
      prince at his temporary home, he was missing. His bed showed no signs of
      having been slept in during the night; but the eiderdown quilt was not to
      be seen. It was only about the breakfast hour that the butler found His
      Highness, wrapped in the eiderdown quilt, <i>under the bed.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      He had occupied a lower bunk in a cabin aboard the P. &amp; O. steamer on
      the voyage to England, and he had taken it for granted that the sleeping
      accommodation in the house where he was an honoured guest was of the same
      restricted type. He had thus naturally crept under the bed, so that some
      one else might enjoy repose in the upper and rather roomier compartment.

      The transition from Irish inns to Irish railways is not a violent one. On
      the great trunk lines the management is sufficiently good to present no
      opportunities for humorous reminiscences. It is with railways as with
      hotels: the more perfectly appointed they are, the less humorous are the
      incidents associated with them in the recollection of a traveller. It is
      safe to assume that, as a general rule, native wit keeps clear of a line
      of rails. Mr. Baring Gould is good enough to explain, in his &ldquo;Strange
      Survivals and Superstitions,&rdquo; that the fairy legend is but a shadowy
      tradition of the inhabitants during the Stone Age; and he also explains
      how it came about that iron was accepted as a potent agent for driving
      away these humorous folk. The iron road has certainly driven the witty
      aborigines into the remote districts of Ireland. A railway guard has never
      been known to convulse the passengers with his dry wit as he snips their
      tickets, nor do the clerks at the pigeon-holes take any particular trouble
      to Hash out a <i>bon mot</i> as one counts one&rsquo;s change. The man who,
      after pouring out the thanks of the West for the relief meal given to the
      people during the last failure of the potato and every other crop, said,
      &ldquo;Troth, if it wasn&rsquo;t for the famine we&rsquo;d all be starving entirely,&rdquo; lived
      far from the sound of the whistle of an engine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, I have now and again come upon something on an Irish railway that
      was droll by reason of its incongruity. There was a station-master at a
      small town on an important line, who seemed a survival of the leisurely
      days of our grandfathers. He invariably strolled round the carriages to
      ask the passengers if they were quite comfortable, just as the
      conscientious head waiter at the &ldquo;<i>Trois Frères</i>&rdquo; used to do in
      respect of his patrons. He would suggest here and there that a window
      might be closed, as the morning air was sometimes very treacherous. He
      even pressed foot-warmers upon the occupants of the second-class
      carriages. He was the friend of all the matrons who were in the habit of
      travelling by the line, and he inquired after their numerous ailments
      (including babies), and listened with dignified attention while they told
      him all that should be told in public&mdash;sometimes a trifle more. A
      medical student would learn as much about a very interesting branch of the
      profession through paying attention to the exchange of confidences at that
      station, as he would by walking the hospitals for a year. The
      station-master was greatly looked up to by agriculturists, and it was
      commonly reported that there was no better judge of the weather to be
      found in the immediate neighbourhood of the station.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was really quite absurd to hear English commercial travellers and other
      persons in the train, who had not become aware of the good qualities of
      this most estimable man, grumbling because the train usually remained at
      this platform for ten minutes instead of the two minutes allotted to it in
      the &ldquo;A B C.&rdquo; The engine-drivers, it was said, also growled at being forced
      to run the twenty miles on either side of this station at as fast a rate
      as forty miles an hour, instead of the thirty to which they had accustomed
      themselves, to save their time. The cutting remarks of the impatient
      passengers made no impression upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, station-master,&rdquo; cried a commercial gentleman one day when the
      official had come across quite an unusual number of acquaintances, &ldquo;is
      there a breakdown on the line?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know indeed, sir, but I&rsquo;ll try and find out for you,&rdquo; said the
      station-master blandly. He went off hurriedly (for him), and did not
      return for five minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve telegraphed up the line, sir,&rdquo; said he to the gentleman, who only
      meant to be delicately sarcastic, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m happy to assure you that no
      information regarding a breakdown has reached any of the principal
      stations. It has been raining at Ballynamuck, but I don&rsquo;t think it will
      continue long. Can I do anything more for you, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, thank you,&rdquo; said the commercial gentleman meekly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can find out for you if the Holyhead steamer has had a good passage, if
      you don&rsquo;t mind waiting for a few minutes,&rdquo; suggested the official. &ldquo;What!
      you are anxious to get on? Certainly, sir; I&rsquo;ll tell the guard. Good
      morning, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the train was at last in motion a wiry old man in a corner pulled out
      his watch, and then turned to the commercial traveller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you aware, sir,&rdquo; he said tartly, &ldquo;that your confounded inquiries kept
      us back just seven minutes? You should have some consideration for your
      fellow-passengers, let me tell you, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A murmur of assent went round the compartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon another occasion a passenger, on arriving at the station over whose
      destinies this courteous official presided, put his head out of the
      carriage window, and inquired if the train had arrived punctually.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; replied the station-master, &ldquo;very punctually: seven minutes
      late to a second.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Upon another occasion I heard him say to an inquirer,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no, sir; I wasn&rsquo;t originally an Irishman. I am one now, however.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By heavens!&rdquo; said some one at the further end of the compartment, &ldquo;that
      reply removes all doubt on the subject.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Several years ago I was staying at Lord Avonmore&rsquo;s picturesque lodge at
      the head of Lough Dearg. A fellow-guest received a telegram one Sunday
      afternoon which compelled his immediate departure, and seeing by the
      railway time-table that a train left the nearest station at 7.45, we drove
      in shortly before that hour. There was, however, no sign of life on the
      little platform up to 7.50. Thereupon my friend became anxious, and we
      hunted in every direction for even the humblest official. After some
      trouble we found a porter asleep on a pile of cushions in the lamp-room.
      We roused him and said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a train marked on the time-table to leave here at 7.45, but it&rsquo;s
      now 7.50, and there&rsquo;s no sign of a train. What time may we expect it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, sir, for myself.&rdquo; said the porter, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ll ask the
      station-master.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We followed him down the platform, and then a man, in his shirt sleeves,
      came out of an office.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. O&rsquo;Flaherty,&rdquo; cried the porter, &ldquo;here&rsquo;s two gentlemen that wants to
      know, if you please, at what o&rsquo;clock the 7.45 train leaves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It leaves at eight on weekdays and a quarter past eight on Sundays,&rdquo; was
      the thoughtful reply.
    </p>
    <p>

    <p>
      It is reported that on the same branch, an engine-driver, on reaching the
      station more than usually behind his time, declared that he had never
      known &ldquo;herself&rdquo;&mdash;meaning the engine&mdash;to be so sluggish before.
      She needed a deal of rousing before he could get any work whatever out of
      her, he said; and she had pulled up at the platform without a hand being
      put to the brake. When he tried to start the engine again he failed
      utterly in his attempt. She had &ldquo;rusted,&rdquo; he said, and when an engine
      rusted she was more stubborn than any horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a passenger who eventually suggested that perhaps if the brakes
      were turned off, the engine might have a better chance of doing its work.
    </p>
    <p>
      This suggestion led to an examination of the brake wheels of the engine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By me sowl, that&rsquo;s a joke!&rdquo; said the engine-driver. &ldquo;If I haven&rsquo;t been
      driving her through the county Tipperary with the brakes on!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so he had.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      On a branch line farther north the official staff were said to be so
      extremely fond of the Irish National game of cards&mdash;it is called
      &ldquo;Spoil Five&rdquo;&mdash;that the guard, engine-driver, and stoker invariably
      took a hand at it on the tool-box on the tender&mdash;a poor substitute
      for a table, the guard explained to an interested passenger who made
      inquiries on the subject, but it served well enough at a pinch, and it was
      not for him to complain. He was right: it was for the passengers to
      complain, and some of them did so; and a remonstrance was sent to the
      staff which practically amounted to a prohibition of any game of cards on
      the engine when the train was in motion. It was very reasonably pointed
      out by the manager that, unless the greatest watchfulness were observed by
      the guard, he might, when engaged at the game, allow the train to run past
      some station at which it was advertised to stop&mdash;as a matter of fact
      this had frequently occurred. Besides, the manager said, persistence in
      the practice under the conditions just described could not but tend to the
      deterioration of the staff as card-players; so he trusted that they would
      see that it was advisable to give their undivided attention to their
      official duties.
    </p>
    <p>
      The staff cheerfully acquiesced, admitting that now and again it was a
      great strain upon them to recollect what cards were out, and at the same
      time what was the name of the station just passed. The fact that the guard
      had been remiss enough, on throwing down the hand that had just been dealt
      to him on the arrival of the train at Ballycruiskeen, to walk down the
      platform crying out &ldquo;Hearts is thrumps!&rdquo; instead of the name of the
      station, helped to make him at least see the wisdom of the manager&rsquo;s
      remonstrance; and no more &ldquo;Spoil Five&rdquo; was played while the engine was in
      motion.
    </p>
    <p>
      But every time the train made a stoppage, the cards were shuffled on the
      engine, and the station-master for the time being took a hand, as well as
      any passenger who had a mind to contribute to the pool. Now and again,
      however, a passenger turned up who was in a hurry to get to his journey&rsquo;s
      end, and made something of a scene&mdash;greatly to the annoyance of the
      players, and the couple of policemen, and the porter or two, who had the
      <i>entrée</i> to the &ldquo;table.&rdquo; Upon one occasion such a passenger appeared,
      and, in considerable excitement, pointed out that the train had taken
      seventy-five minutes to do eight miles. He declared that this was
      insufferable, and that, sooner than stand it any longer, he would walk the
      remainder of the distance to his destination.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was actually showing signs of carrying out his threat, when the guard
      threw down his hand, dismounted from the engine and came behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, sir, you&rsquo;ll get into the train again, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;ll be hanged if I will,&rdquo; shouted the passenger. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no time to
      waste, I&rsquo;ll walk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, no, sir; you&rsquo;ll get into the train. Do, sir; and you&rsquo;ll be at the end
      of the journey every bit as soon as if you walked,&rdquo; urged the official.
    </p>
    <p>
      His assurance on this point prevailed, and the passenger returned to his
      carriage. But unless the speed upon that occasion was a good deal greater
      than it was when I travelled over the same line, it is questionable if he
      would not have been on the safe side in walking.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE people who
      spend their time writing letters to newspapers pointing out mistakes, or
      what they imagine to be mistakes, and making many suggestions as to how
      the newspaper should be conducted in all its departments, constitute a
      branch of the profession of philanthropy, to which sufficient attention
      has never been given.
    </p>
    <p>
      I do not, of course, allude to the type whom Mr. George Du Maurier derided
      when he put the phrase <i>J&rsquo;écrirai à le Times</i> into his mouth on being
      compelled to pay an extravagant bill at a French hotel; there are people
      who have just grievances to expose, and there are newspapers that exist
      for the dissemination of those grievances; but it is an awful thought that
      at this very moment there are some hundreds&mdash;perhaps thousands&mdash;of
      presumably sane men and women sitting down and writing letters to their
      local newspapers to point out to the management that the jeu d&rsquo;esprit
      attributed in yesterday&rsquo;s issue to Sydney Smith, was one of which Douglas
      Jerrold was really the author; or that the quotation about the wind being
      tempered to the shorn lamb is not to be found in the Bible, but in &ldquo;the
      works of the late Mr. Sterne&rdquo;; or perhaps suggesting that no country could
      rightly be regarded as exempted from the list of lands forming a
      legitimate sphere for missionary labour, whose newspapers give up four
      columns daily to an account of the horse-racing of the day before. A book
      might easily be written by any one who had some experience, not of the
      letters that appear in a newspaper, but of those that are sent to the
      editor by enthusiasts on the subject of finance, morality, religion, and
      the correct text of some of Burns dialect poems.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Lord Tennyson died, I printed five columns of a biographical and
      critical sketch of the great poet. I thought it necessary to quote only a
      single stanza of &ldquo;Crossing the Bar.&rdquo; During the next clay I received quite
      a number of letters asking in what volume of Tennyson&rsquo;s works the poem was
      to be found. In the succeeding issue of the paper I gave the poem in full.
      From that day on during the next fortnight, no post arrived without
      bringing me a letter containing the same poem, with a request to have it
      published in the following issue; and every writer seemed to be under the
      impression that he (or she) had just discovered &ldquo;Crossing the Bar.&rdquo; Then
      the clergymen who forwarded in manuscript the sermons which they had
      preached on Tennyson, pointing out the &ldquo;lessons&rdquo; of his poems, presented
      their compliments and requested the insertion of &ldquo;Crossing the Bar,&rdquo; <i>in
      its entirety</i>, in the place in the sermons where they had quoted it.
      All this time &ldquo;poems&rdquo; on the death of Tennyson kept pouring in by the
      hundred, and I can safely say that not one came under my notice that did
      not begin,
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;Yes, thou hast cross&rsquo;d the Bar, and face to face
    </p>
    <p class="indent30">
      Thy Pilot seen,&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      or with words to that effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      After this had been going on for some weeks a member of the proprietorial
      household came to me with a letter open in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder how it was that we missed that poem of Tennyson&rsquo;s.&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;It
      would have done well, I think, if it had been published in our columns at
      his death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What poem is that?&rdquo; I inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is it,&rdquo; he replied, offering me the letter which he held. &ldquo;A
      personal friend of my own sends it to me for insertion. It is called
      &lsquo;Crossing the Bar.&rsquo; Have you ever seen it before?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The aggregate thickness of skull of the proprietorial household was
      phenomenal.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      When writing on the subject of this poem I may perhaps be permitted to
      express the opinion, that the remarks made about it in some directions
      were the most astounding that ever appeared in print respecting a
      composition of the character of &ldquo;Crossing the Bar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      One writer, it may be remembered, took occasion to point out that the
      &ldquo;Pilot&rdquo; was, of course, the poet&rsquo;s son, by whom he had been predeceased.
      The &ldquo;thought&rdquo; was, we were assured, that his son had gone before him to
      show him the direction to take, so to speak. Now whatever the &ldquo;thought&rdquo; of
      the poet was, the thought of this commentator converged not upon a pilot
      but a pilot-engine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then another writer was found anxious to point out that Tennyson&rsquo;s
      navigation was defective. &ldquo;What would be the use of a pilot when the bar
      was already crossed?&rdquo; was the question asked by this earnest inquirer.
      This gentleman&rsquo;s idea clearly was that Tennyson should have subjected
      himself to a course of Mr. Clark Russell before attempting to write such a
      poem as &ldquo;Crossing the Bar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The fact was that Tennyson knew enough navigation for a poet, just as Mr.
      Gladstone knows enough for a premier. When the two most picturesque of
      Englishmen (assuming that Mr. Gladstone is an Englishman) took their
      cruise together in a steam yacht they kept their eyes open, I have good
      reason to know. I question very much if the most ideal salt in the
      mercantile marine could make a better attempt to describe some incidents
      of the sea than Tennyson did in &ldquo;Enoch Arden&rdquo;; and as the Boston gentleman
      was doubtful if more than six men in his city could write &ldquo;Hamlet,&rdquo; so I
      doubt if the same number of able-bodied seamen, whose command of emphatic
      language is noted, could bring before our eyes the sight, and send rushing
      through our ears the sound, of a breaking wave, with greater emphasis than
      Tennyson did when he wrote,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      &ldquo;As the crest of some slow-arching wave
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Heard in dead night along that table-shore
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Drops flat; and after the great waters break,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Whitening for half a league, and thin themselves
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Far over sands marbled with moon and cloud
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      From less and less to nothing.&lsquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      It was after he had returned from his last voyage with Mr. Gladstone that
      Tennyson wrote &ldquo;Crossing the Bar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was after Mr. Gladstone had returned from the same voyage that he
      consolidated his reputation as a statesman by a translation of &ldquo;Rock of
      Ages&rdquo; into Italian. He then made Tennyson a peer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps it may not be considered an impertinence on my part if I give, in
      this place, an instance, which came under my notice, of the eclectic
      nature of Lord Tennyson&rsquo;s interest in even the least artistic branches of
      literary work. A relative of mine went to Aldworth to lunch with the
      family of the poet only a few weeks before his death saddened every home
      in England. Lord Tennyson received his guest in his favourite room; he was
      seated on a sofa at a window overlooking the autumn russet landscape, and
      he wore a black velvet coat, which made his long delicate fingers seem
      doubly pathetic in their worn whiteness. He had been reading, and laid
      down the book to greet his visitor. This book was &ldquo;My Official Wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now the author of the story so entitled is not the man to talk of his
      &ldquo;Art,&rdquo; as so many inferior writers do, in season and out of season. He
      knows that his stories are no more deserving of being regarded as
      high-class literature than is the scrappy volume at which I am now
      engaged. He knows, however, that he is an excellent exponent of a form of
      art that interests thousands of people on both sides of the Atlantic; and
      the fact that Tennyson was able to read such a story as &ldquo;My Official Wife&rdquo;
       seems to me to show how much the poet was interested in a very significant
      phase of the constantly varying taste of the great mass of English
      readers.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is the possession of such a sympathetic nature as this that prevents a
      man from ever growing old. Mr. Gladstone also seems to read everything
      that comes in his way, and he is never so busy as to be unable to snatch a
      moment to write a word of kindly commendation upon an excessively dull
      book.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not only upon the occasion of the death of a great man or a prince
      that some people are obliging enough to give an editor a valuable hint or
      two as to the standpoint from which the character of the deceased should
      be judged. They now and again express themselves with great freedom on the
      subject of living men, and are especially frank in their references to the
      private lives of the best-known and most highly respected gentlemen. It
      is, however, the performances of actors that form the most fruitful
      subject of irresponsible comment for &ldquo;outsiders.&rdquo; It has often seemed to
      me that every man has his own idea of the way &ldquo;Hamlet&rdquo; should be
      represented. When I was engaged in newspaper work I found that every new
      representation of the play was received by some people as the noblest
      effort to realise the character, while others were of the opinion that the
      actor might have found a more legitimate subject than this particular play
      for burlesque treatment. Mr. Edwin Booth once told me a story&mdash;I dare
      say it may be known in the United States&mdash;that would tend to convey
      the impression that the study of Hamlet has made its way among the
      coloured population as well as the colourless&mdash;if there are any&mdash;of
      America.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Booth said that he was acting in New Orleans, and when at the hotel,
      his wants were enthusiastically attended to by a negro waiter. At every
      meal the man showed his zeal in a very marked way, particularly by never
      allowing another waiter to come within hailing distance of his chair. Such
      attention, the actor thought, should be rewarded, so he asked Caractacus
      if he would care to have an order for the theatre. The waiter declared
      that if he only had the chance of seeing Mr. Booth on the stage, he (the
      waiter) would die happy when his time came. The actor at once gave him an
      order for the same night, and the next morning he found the man all teeth
      and eyes behind his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Caractacus, did you manage to go to the theatre last night?&rdquo; asked
      Booth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I jus&rsquo;, Massa Boove,&rdquo; cried the waiter beaming.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how did you enjoy the piece?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jus&rsquo; lubly, sah; nebber onjoyed moself so well&mdash;it kep&rsquo; me in a roar
      o&rsquo; larfta de whole ebening, sah. Oh, Massa Boove, you was too funny.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The play that had been performed was <i>Hamlet.</i>
    </p>

      I chanced to be residing for a time in a large manufacturing town which
      Mr. Irving visited when &ldquo;touring&rdquo; some twelve years ago. In that town an
      enthusiastic admirer of Mr. Irving&rsquo;s lived, and he was, with Mr. Irving
      and myself, a guest of the mayor&rsquo;s at a dinner party on one Sunday night.
      In the drawing-room of the mayoress the great actor repeated his favourite
      poem&mdash;&ldquo;Gemini and Virgo,&rdquo; from Calverley&rsquo;s &ldquo;Verses and Translations,&rdquo;
       dealing with inimitable grace with the dainty humour of this exquisite
      trifle; and naturally, every one present was delighted. For myself I may
      say that, frequently though I had heard Mr. Irving repeat the verses.
    </p>
    <p>
      I felt that he had never before brought to bear upon them the consummate
      art of that high comedy of which he is the greatest living exponent. But I
      could not help noticing that the gentleman who had protested so
      enthusiastic an admiration for the actor, was greatly puzzled as the
      recitation went on, and I came to the conclusion that he had not the
      remotest idea what it was all about. When some ladies laughed outright at
      the delivery of the lines, with matchless adroitness,

      There was no doubt about the matter.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      I said he must resign, or stand
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      My vengeance&mdash;and he chose the latter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      But by this time it had dawned upon the jealous guardian of Mr. Irving&rsquo;s
      professional reputation that the poem was meant to be a trifle humorous,
      and so soon as he became convinced of this, he almost interrupted the
      reciter with his uproarious hilarity, especially at places where the
      humour was far too subtle for laughter; and at the close he wiped his eyes
      and declared that the fun was too much for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      I asked a relative of his if he thought that the man had the slightest
      notion of what the poem was about, and his relative said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It might be in Sanskrit for all he understands of it. He loves Mr. Irving
      for himself alone. He has got no idea of art.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Later in the night the conversation turned upon the difference between the
      elocutionary modes of expression of the past and the present day. In
      illustration of a point associated with the question of effect, Mr. Irving
      gave me at least a thrill such as I had never before experienced through
      the medium of his art, by repeating,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;To be or not to be: that is the question.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Before he had reached the words,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      &ldquo;To die: to sleep:
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      No more,&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      I felt that I had suddenly had a revelation made to me of the utmost
      limits of art; that I had been permitted a glimpse behind the veil, if I
      may be allowed the expression; that I had been permitted to take a single
      glance into a world whose very name is a mystery to the sons of men.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every one present seemed spellbound. A commonplace man who sat next to me,
      drew a long breath&mdash;it was almost a gasp&mdash;and said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is too much altogether for such people us we are. My God! I don&rsquo;t
      know what I saw&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know how I come to be here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He could not have expressed better what my feeling was; and yet I had seen
      Mr. Irving&rsquo;s Hamlet seventeen times, so that I might have been looked upon
      as unsusceptible to any further revelation on a point in connection with
      the soliloquy.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I glanced round I saw Mr. Irving&rsquo;s enthusiastic admirer once more
      wiping the tears of laughter from his eyes. It was not, however, until Mr.
      Irving was in the act of reciting &ldquo;The Dream of Eugene Aram,&rdquo; that the
      same gentleman yielded to what he conceived to be the greatest comic treat
      of the evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      Happily he occupied a back seat, and smothered his laughter behind a huge
      red handkerchief, which was guffaw-proof.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a little lower than the negro waiter in his appreciation of the
      actor&rsquo;s art.
    </p>
    <p>
      A year afterwards I met the same gentleman at an hotel in Scotland, and he
      reminded me of the dinner-party at the mayor&rsquo;s. His admiration for Mr.
      Irving had in no degree diminished. He was partaking of a simple lunch of
      cold beef and pickled onions; and when he began to speak of the talents of
      the actor, he was helping himself to an onion, but so excited did he
      become that instead of dropping the dainty on his plate, he put it into
      his mouth, and after a crunch or two, swallowed it. Then he helped himself
      to a second, and crunched and talked away, while my cheeks became wrinkled
      merely through watching him. He continued automatically ladling the onions
      into his mouth until the jar was nearly empty, and the roof of my mouth
      felt crinkly. Fortunately a waiter came up&mdash;he had clearly been
      watching the man, and perceived that the hotel halfcrown lunch in this
      particular case would result in a loss to the establishment&mdash;and
      politely inquired if he had quite done with the pickle bottle, as another
      gentleman was asking for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I wondered how the man felt after the lapse of an hour or so. I could not
      but believe in the sincerity of a devotion that manifested itself in so
      striking a manner.

      I have mentioned &ldquo;The Dream of Eugene Aram.&rdquo; Has any one ever attempted to
      identify the &ldquo;little boy&rdquo; who was the recipient of the harrowing tale of
      the usher? In my mind there is no doubt that the &ldquo;gentle lad&rdquo; whom Hood
      had in his eye was none other than James Burney, son of Dr. Burney, and
      brother of the writer of &ldquo;Evelina.&rdquo; He was a pupil at the school near Lynn
      which was fortunate enough to obtain the services of Eugene Aram as usher;
      and I have no doubt that, when he settled down in London, after joining in
      the explorations of Captain Cook, he excited the imagination of his friend
      Hood by his reminiscences of his immortal usher.

      Gessner&rsquo;s &ldquo;Death of Abel&rdquo; was published in England before the edition,

      Burney carried his Bible about with him.

    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span> DID not mean to
      enter upon a course of theatrical anecdotage in these pages, but having
      mentioned the name of a great actor recently dead, I cannot refrain from
      making a brief reference to what was certainly one of the most interesting
      episodes in his career. I allude to Mr. Edwin Booth&rsquo;s professional visit
      to London in 1881. It may truthfully be said that if Mr. Booth was not
      wholly responsible for the financial failure of his abbreviated &ldquo;season&rdquo;
       at the Princess&rsquo;s Theatre, neither was he wholly responsible for his
      subsequent success at the Lyceum. I should like, however, to have an
      opportunity of bearing testimony to his frank and generous appreciation of
      the courtesy shown to him by Mr. Henry Irving, in inviting him to play in
      <i>Othello</i>. when it became plain that the performances of the American
      actor at the Princess&rsquo;s were not likely to make his reputation in England.
      It would be impossible for me to forget the genuine emotion shown by Mr.
      Booth when, on the Saturday night that brought to a close the notable
      representations of <i>Othello</i> at the Lyceum, he referred to the
      kindness which he had received at that theatre. Although the occasion to
      which I refer was the most private of private suppers, I do not feel that
      I can be accused of transgressing the accepted <i>codex</i> of the
      Beefsteak Room in touching upon a matter which is now of public interest.
      Early in the week Mr. Irving had been good enough to invite me to meet Mr.
      Booth at supper on the Saturday. After the performance, in which Mr.
      Irving was Othello and Mr. Booth Iago, I found in the supper-room, in
      addition to the host and the guest of the evening, Mr. John McCullough,
      who, it will be remembered, paid a visit to England at the same time as
      Mr. Booth; and a member of Parliament who subsequently became the Leader
      of the House of Commons. Mr. J. L. Toole and Mr. Bram Stoker subsequently
      arrived. We found a good deal to talk about, and it was rather late&mdash;too
      late for the one guest who was unconnected with theatrical matters (at
      least, those outside St. Stephen&rsquo;s)&mdash;when Mr. Irving, in a few of
      those graceful, informal sentences which he seems always to have at his
      command, and only rising to his feet for a moment, asked us to drink to
      the health of Mr. Booth. Mr. Irving, I recollect, referred to the fact
      that the representations of <i>Othello</i> had filled the theatre nightly,
      and that the instant the American actor appeared, the English actor had to
      &ldquo;take a back seat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The playful tone assumed by him was certainly not sustained by Mr. Booth.
      It would be impossible to doubt that he made his reply under the influence
      of the deepest feeling. He could scarcely speak at first, and when at last
      he found words, they were the words of a man whose eyes are full of tears.
      &ldquo;You all know how I came here,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You all know that I went to
      another theatre in London, and that I was a big failure, although some
      newspaper writers on my side of the water had said that I would make Henry
      Irving and the other English actors sit up. Well, I didn&rsquo;t make them sit
      up. Yes, I was a big failure. But what happened then? Henry Irving invites
      me to act with him at his theatre, and makes me share the success which he
      has so well earned. He changes my big failure into a big success. What can
      I say about such generosity? Was the like of it ever seen before? I am
      left without words. Friend Irving, I have no words to thank you.&rdquo; The two
      actors got upon their feet, and as they clasped hands, both of them
      overcome, I could not help feeling that I was looking upon an emblematic
      tableau of the artistic union of the Old World and the New. So I was.

      I could not help contrasting this graceful little incident with the more
      memorable episode which had taken place in the same building some years
      previously. On the evening of February 14th, 1880, Mr. Irving gave a
      supper on the stage of the Lyceum, to celebrate the hundredth
      representation of <i>The Merchant of Venice</i>. I do not suppose that
      upon any occasion within the memory of a middle-aged man so remarkable a
      gathering had assembled at the bidding of an actor. Every notable man in
      every department of literature, art, and science seemed to me to be
      present. The most highly representative painters, poets, novelists,
      play-writers, actors of plays, composers of operas, singers of operas,
      composers of laws, exponents of the meaning of these laws, journalists,
      financiers,&mdash;all this goodly company attended on that moist Saturday
      night to congratulate the actor upon one of the most signal triumphs of
      the latter half of the century. Of course it was well understood by Mr.
      Irving&rsquo;s personal friends that an omission of their names from the list of
      invitations to this marvellous function was inevitable. Capacious though
      the stage of the Lyceum is, it would not meet the strain that would be put
      on it if all the personal friends of Mr. Irving were to be invited to the
      supper. So soon as I heard, however, that every living author who had
      written a play that had been produced at the Lyceum Theatre would be
      invited, I knew that, in spite of the fact that I only escaped by the skin
      of my teeth being an absolute nonentity&mdash;I had only published nine
      volumes in those days&mdash;I would not be an &ldquo;outsider&rdquo; upon this
      occasion. Two years previously a comedietta of mine had been played at
      this theatre for some hundred nights, while the audience were being shown
      to their places and were chatting genially with the friends whom they
      recognised three or four seats away. That was my play. No human being
      could deprive me of the consciousness of having written a play that was
      produced at the Lyceum Theatre. It was not a great feat, but it
      constituted a privilege of which I was not slow to avail myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The invitations were all in the handwriting of Mr. Irving, and the <i>menu</i>
      was, in the words of Joseph in &ldquo;Divorçons,&rdquo; <i>délicat, distingué&mdash;très
      distingué</i>. While we were smoking some cigars the merits of which have
      never been adequately sung, though they would constitute a theme at least
      equal to that of the majority of epics, our host strolled round the
      tables, shaking hands and talking with every one in that natural way of
      his, which proves conclusively that at least one trait of Garrick&rsquo;s has
      never been shared by him.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;Twas only that when he was off he was acting,&rdquo;

    </p>
    <p>
      wrote Garrick&rsquo;s&mdash;and everybody else&rsquo;s&mdash;friend, Goldsmith. No;
      Mr. Irving cannot claim to be the inheritor of all the arts of Garrick.
    </p>
    <p>
      More than an hour had passed before Lord Houghton rose to propose the
      toast of the evening. He did so very fluently. He had evidently prepared
      his speech with great care; and as the <i>doyen</i> of literature&mdash;the
      true patron of art and letters during two generations&mdash;his right to
      speak as one having authority could not be questioned. No one expected a
      commonplace speech from Lord Houghton, but few of Mr. Irving&rsquo;s guests
      could have looked for precisely such a speech as he delivered. It struck a
      note of far-reaching criticism, and was full of that friendly counsel
      which the varied experiences of the speaker made doubly valuable. Its
      commendation of the great actor was wholly free from that meaningless
      adulation, which is as distasteful to any artist who knows the limitations
      of his art, as it is prejudicial to the realisation of his aims. In his
      masterly biography of the late Lord Houghton, Mr. Wemyss Reid refers to
      the great admiration which Lord Houghton had for Mr. Irving; and this
      admiration was quite consistent with the tone of the speech in which he
      proposed the health of our host. It was probably Lord Houghton&rsquo;s sincere
      appreciation of the aims of Mr. Irving that caused him to make some
      delicate allusion to the dangers of long runs. Considering that we had
      assembled on the stage of the Lyceum to celebrate a phenomenal run on that
      stage, the difficulty of the course which Lord Houghton had to steer in
      order to avoid giving the least offence to even the most susceptible of
      his audience, will be easily recognised. There were present several
      playwriters who, by the exercise of great dexterity, had succeeded in
      avoiding all their lives the pitfall of the long run; and these gentlemen
      listened, with mournful acquiescence, while Lord Houghton showed, as he
      did quite conclusively, that, on the whole, the interests of dramatic art
      are best advanced by adopting the principles which form the basis of the
      Théâtre Français. But there were also present some managers who had been
      weak enough to allow certain plays which they had produced, to linger on
      the stage, evening after evening, so long as the public chose to pay their
      money to see them. I glanced at one of these gentlemen while Lord Houghton
      was delivering his tactful address, and I cannot say that the result of my
      glance was to assure me that the remarks of his lordship were convincing
      to that manager. Contrition for those past misdeeds that took the form of
      five-hundred-night runs was not the most noticeable expression upon his
      features. But then the manager was an actor as well, so that he may only
      have been concealing his remorse behind a smiling face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Irving&rsquo;s reply was excellent. With amazing good-humour he touched upon
      almost every point brought forward by Lord Houghton, referring to his own
      position somewhat apologetically. Lord Houghton had, however, made the
      apologetic tone inevitable; but after a short time Mr. Irving struck the
      note for which his friends had been waiting, and spoke strongly,
      earnestly, and eloquently on behalf of the art of which he hoped to be the
      exponent.
    </p>
    <p>
      We who knew how splendid were the aims of the hero of a hundred nights,
      with what sincerity and at how great self-sacrifice he had endeavoured to
      realize them; we who had watched his career in the past, and were
      hopefully looking forward to a future for the English drama in a
      legitimate home; we who were enthusiastic almost to a point of passion in
      our love and reverence for the art of which we believed Irving to be the
      greatest interpreter of our generation,&mdash;we, I say, felt that we
      should not separate before one more word at least was spoken to our friend
      whose triumph we regarded as our own.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Mr. J. L. Toole, our host&rsquo;s oldest and closest friend, who, in the
      Beefsteak Room some hours after midnight, expressed, in a few words that
      came from his heart and were echoed by ours, how deeply Mr. Irving&rsquo;s
      triumph was felt by all who enjoyed his friendship&mdash;by all who
      appreciated the difficulties which he had surmounted, and who, having at
      heart the best interests of the drama, stretched forth to him hands of
      sympathy and encouragement, and wished him God-speed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus closed a memorable gathering, the chief incidents in which I have
      ventured to chronicle exactly as they appeared to me.

    <p>
      Only to one more Lyceum performance may I refer in this place. It may be
      remembered that ten or eleven years ago the late Mr. Dion Boucicault was
      obliging enough to offer to give a lecture to English actors on the
      correct pronunciation of their mother-tongue. The offer was, I suppose,
      thought too valuable to be neglected, and it was arranged that the lecture
      should be delivered from the stage of the Lyceum Theatre. A more
      interesting and amusing function I have never attended. It was clear that
      the lecturer had formed some very definite ideas as to the way the English
      language should be spoken; and his attempts to convey these ideas to his
      audience were most praiseworthy. His illustrations of the curiosities of
      some methods of pronouncing words were certainly extremely curious. For
      instance, he complained bitterly of the way the majority of English actors
      pronounced the word &ldquo;war.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye prenounce the ward as if it wuz spelt w-a-u-g-h,&rdquo; said the lecturer
      gravely. &ldquo;Ye don&rsquo;t prenounce it at all as ye shud. The ward rhymes with
      &lsquo;par, &lsquo;are,&rsquo; and &lsquo;kyar,&rsquo; and yet ye will prenounce it as if it rhymed with
      &lsquo;saw&rsquo; and &lsquo;Paw-&rsquo; Don&rsquo;t ye see the diffurnce?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We do, we do!&rdquo; cried the audience; and, thus encouraged by the ready
      acquiescence in his pet theories, the lecturer went on to deal with the
      gross absurdity of pronouncing the word &ldquo;grass,&rdquo; not to rhyme with &ldquo;lass,&rdquo;
       which of course was the correct way, but almost&mdash;not quite&mdash;as
      if it rhymed with &ldquo;laws.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The ward is &lsquo;grass,&rsquo; not &lsquo;graws,&rsquo;&rdquo; said our lecturer. &ldquo;It grates on a
      sinsitive ear like mine to hear it misprenounced. Then ye will never be
      injuced to give the ward &lsquo;Chrischin&rsquo; its thrue value as a ward of three
      syllables; ye&rsquo;ll insist on calling it &lsquo;Christyen,&rsquo; in place of
      &lsquo;Chrischin.&rsquo; D&rsquo;ye persave the diffurnce?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We do, we do!&rdquo; cried the audience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, and ye talk about &lsquo;soots&rsquo; of gyar-ments, when everybody knows that ye
      shud say &lsquo;shoots&rsquo;; ye must give the full valye to the letter &lsquo;u&rsquo;&mdash;there&rsquo;s
      no double o in a shoot of clothes. Moreover, ye talk of the mimbers of the
      polis force as &lsquo;cunstables,&rsquo; but there&rsquo;s no &lsquo;u&rsquo; in the first syllable&mdash;it&rsquo;s
      an &lsquo;o,&rsquo; and it shud be prenounced to rhyme with &lsquo;gone,&rsquo; not with &lsquo;gun.&rsquo; 
      Then I&rsquo;ve heard an actor who shud know better say, in the part of Hamlet,
      &lsquo;wurds, wurds, wurds&rsquo;; instead of giving that fine letter &lsquo;o&rsquo; its full
      value. How much finer it sounds to prenounce it as I do, &lsquo;wards, wards,
      wards&rsquo;! But when I say that I&rsquo;ve heard the ward &lsquo;pull&rsquo; prenounced not to
      rhyme with &lsquo;dull,&rsquo; as ye&rsquo;ll all admit it shud be, but actually as if it
      was within an ace of being spelt &lsquo;p double o l,&rsquo; I think yell agree with
      me that it&rsquo;s about time that actors learnt something of the rudiments of
      the art of ellycution.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I do not pretend that these are the exact instances given by Mr.
      Boucicault of the appalling incorrectness of English pronunciation, but I
      know that he began with the word &ldquo;war,&rdquo; and that the impression produced
      upon my mind by the discourse was precisely as I have recorded it.

      There is a tradition at Trinity College, Dublin, that a student who spoke
      with a lovely brogue used every art to conceal it, but with indifferent
      success; for however perfect the &ldquo;English accent&rdquo; which he flattered
      himself he had grafted upon the parent stem indigenous to Kerry may have
      been when he was cool and collected, yet in moments of excitement&mdash;chiefly
      after supper&mdash;the old brogue surrounded him like a fog. This was a
      great grief to him; but his own weakness in this way caused him to feel a
      deep respect for the natives of England.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a visit to London he gave the result of his observations in a few
      words to his friends at the College.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Boys,&rdquo; he cried, the &ldquo;English chaps are a poor lot, no matter how you
      look at them. But I will say this for them,&mdash;no matter how drunk any
      one of them may be, he never forgets his English accent.&rdquo;

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>S this rambling
      volume does not profess to be a guide to the newspaper press, I have not
      felt bound to follow any beaten track in its compilation. But I must
      confess that at the outset it was my intention to deal with that agreeable
      phase known as the Lady Journalist. Unhappily (or perhaps I should say,
      happily), &ldquo;the extreme pressure on our space&rdquo; will not permit of my giving
      more than a line or two to a theme which could only be adequately treated
      in a large volume. It has been my privilege to meet with three lady
      journalists, and I am bound to say that every one of the three seemed to
      me to combine in herself all the judgment of the trained journalist (male)
      with the lightness of touch which one associates with the doings of the
      opposite sex. All were able to describe garments in picturesque phrases,
      frequently producing by the employment of a single word an effect that a
      &ldquo;gentleman journalist&rdquo;&mdash;this is, I suppose, the male equivalent to a
      lady journalist&mdash;could not achieve at any price. They wrote of ladies
      being &ldquo;gowned,&rdquo; and they described the exact tint of the gowns by an
      admirable process of comparison with the hue of certain familiar things.
      They rightly considered that the mere statement that somebody came to
      somebody else&rsquo;s &ldquo;At Home&rdquo; in brown, conveys an inadequate idea of the
      colour of a costume: &ldquo;postman&rsquo;s bag brown,&rdquo; however, brings the dress
      before one&rsquo;s eye in a moment. To say that somebody&rsquo;s daughter appeared in
      a grey wrap would sound weak-kneed, but a wrap of <i>eau de Tamise</i> is
      something stimulating. A scarlet tea-jacket merely suggests the Book of
      Revelation, but a Clark-Russell-sunset jacket is altogether different.
    </p>
    <p>
      They also wrote of &ldquo;picture hats,&rdquo; and &ldquo;smart frocks,&rdquo; and many other
      matters which they understood thoroughly. I do not think that any
      newspaper staff that does not include a lady journalist can hope for
      popularity, or for the respect of those who read what is written by the
      lady journalist, which is much better than popularity. I have got good
      reason to know that in every newspaper with which I was associated, the
      weekly column contributed by the lady journalist was much more earnestly
      read than any that came from another source.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, I feel that the position of the lady in modern journalism is
      unassailable; and the lady journalists always speak pleasantly about one
      another, and occasionally describe each other&rsquo;s &ldquo;picture hats.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In brief, the lady journalist is the silver mounting of the newspaper <i>staff</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      I once, however, received an application from a lady, offering a weekly
      letter on a topic already, I considered, ably dealt with by another lady
      in the columns of the newspaper with which I was connected. I wrote
      explaining this to my correspondent, and by the next post I got a letter
      from her telling me that of course she was aware that a letter purporting
      to be on this topic was in the habit of appearing in the paper, but
      expressing the hope that I did not fancy that she would contribute &ldquo;stuff
      of that character.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I did not have the faintest hope on the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now it so happened that the lady who wrote to me had some months before
      gone to the lady whose weekly letters she had derided, and had begged from
      her some suggestions as to the topics most suitable to be dealt with by a
      lady journalist, and whatever further hints she might be pleased to offer
      on the general subject of lady journalism. In short, all that she had
      learned of the profession&mdash;it may be acquired in three lessons, most
      young women think&mdash;she had learned from the lady at whom she pointed
      a finger of scorn.
    </p>
    <p>
      This I did not consider either ladylike or journalist-like, so that I can
      hardly consider it lady-journalist-like.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady journalists have recently taken to photographing each other and
      publishing the results.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is another step in the right direction.
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Once I had an opportunity of talking face to face with a lady journalist.
      It happened at the house of a distinguished actress in London. By the
      merest chance I had a play which I felt certain would suit the actress,
      and I went to make her acquainted with the joyful news. To my great
      chagrin I found that I had arrived on a day when she was &ldquo;receiving.&rdquo;
       Several literary men were present, and on some of their faces.
    </p>
    <p>
      I thought I detected the hang-dog look of the man who carries a play about
      with him without a muzzle. I regret to say that they nearly all looked at
      me with distrust.
    </p>
    <p>
      I came by chance upon one of them speaking to our charming hostess behind
      a <i>portiere</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think the part would suit you down to the ground.&rdquo; he was saying. &ldquo;Yes,
      six changes of dress in the four acts, and one of them a ballroom scene.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I walked on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ten minutes afterwards I overheard a second, who was having a romp with
      our hostess&rsquo;s little girl, say to that lady,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, I am very fond of children, when they are as pretty as Pansy
      here. By the way, that reminds me that I have in my overcoat pocket a
      comedy that I think will give you a chance at last. If you will allow me
      when those people go....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I passed on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The piece I brought with me is very strong. You were always best at
      tragedy, and I have frequently said that you are the only woman in London
      who can speak blank verse,&rdquo; were the words that I heard spoken by the
      third literary gentleman at the further side of a group of palms on a
      pedestal.
    </p>
    <p>
      I thought it better not to say anything about my having a play concealed
      about my person. It occurred to me that it might be well to withhold my
      good news for a day or two. Meantime I had a delightful chat with the lady
      journalist, and confided in her my belief that some of the literary men
      present had not come for the sake of the intellectual treat available at
      every reception of our hostess&rsquo;s, but solely to try and palm off on her
      some rubbish in the way of a play.
    </p>
    <p>
      She replied that she could scarcely believe that any man could be so base,
      and that she feared I was something of a cynic.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she was bidding good-bye to our hostess I distinctly heard the latter
      say,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry that you have only made it in two acts; however, you may
      depend on my reading it carefully, and doing what I can with it for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The above story might be looked on as telling against myself in some
      measure, so I hasten to obviate its effect by mentioning that the play
      which I had in my pocket was acted by the accomplished lady for whom I
      designed it, and that it occupied a dignified place among the failures of
      the year.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a lady journalist&mdash;at least a lady so describing herself&mdash;who
      sent me long accounts of the picture shows three days after I had received
      the telegraphed accounts from the art correspondent employed by the
      newspaper. She wanted to get a start, she said; and it was in vain that I
      tried to point out to her that it was the other writers who got the start
      of her, and that so long as she allowed this to happen she could not
      expect anything that she wrote to be inserted.
    </p>
    <p>
      It so happened, however, that her art criticisms were about on a level
      with those that a child might pass upon a procession of animals to or from
      a Noah&rsquo;s Ark. Then the lady forwarded me criticisms of books that had not
      been sent to me for review, and afterwards an interview or two with
      unknown poets. Nothing that she wrote was worth the space it would have
      occupied.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only last year I learned with sincere pleasure that this energetic lady
      had obtained a permanent place on the staff of a lady&rsquo;s halfpenny weekly
      paper. I could not help wondering on what department she could have been
      allowed to work, and made some inquiry on the subject. Then it was I
      learned that she had been appointed superintendent of the health columns.
      It seems that the readers of this paper are sanguine enough to expect to
      get medical advice of the highest order in respect of their ailments for
      the comparatively trilling expenditure of one halfpenny weekly. By
      forwarding a coupon to show that they have not been mean enough to try and
      shirk payment of the legitimate fee, they are entitled to obtain in the
      health columns a complete reply as to the treatment of whatever symptoms
      they may describe. As this reply is seldom printed in the health columns
      until more than a month or six weeks after the coupon has been sent in to
      the newspaper, addressed &ldquo;M.D.,&rdquo; the extent of the boon that it confers
      upon the suffering&mdash;the long-suffering&mdash;subscribers can easily
      be estimated.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the superintendent of the column signed &ldquo;M.D.,&rdquo; the lady who had failed
      as an art critic, as a reviewer, and as an interviewer, had at last found
      a haven of rest. Of course, when she undertook the duties incidental to
      the post she knew nothing whatever of medicine. But since then, my
      informant assured me that she had been gradually &ldquo;feeling her way,&rdquo; and
      now, by the aid of a half-crown handbook, she can give the best medical
      advice that can be secured in all London for a halfpenny fee.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had the curiosity to glance down one of her columns the other day. It
      ran something like this:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gladys.&mdash;Delighted to hear that you like your new mistress, and that
      the cook is not the tyrant that your last was. As scullery-maid I believe
      you are entitled to every second evening out. But better apply (enclosing
      coupon) to the Superintendent of the Domestic Department. Regarding the
      eruptions on the forehead, they may have been caused by the use of too hot
      curling tongs on your fringe. Why not try the new magnetic curlers? (see
      advertisement, p. 9). It would be hard to be compelled to abandon so
      luxurious a fringe for the sake of a pimple or two. Thanks for your kind
      wishes. Your handwriting is striking, but I must have an impression of
      your palm in wax, or on a piece of paper rubbed with lamp-black, before I
      can predict anything certain regarding your chances of a brilliant
      marriage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Airy Fairy Lilian.&mdash;What a pretty pseudonym! Where did you contrive
      to find it? Yes, I think that perhaps the doctor who visited you was right
      after all. The symptoms were certainly those of typhoid. Have you tried
      the new Omniherbal Typhoid Tablets (see advertisement, p. 8). If not too
      late they might be of real service to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Harebell.&mdash;I should say that if your waist is now forty-two inches,
      it would be extremely imprudent for you to try and reduce it by more than
      ten or eleven inches. Besides, there is no beauty in a wasp-like waist.
      The slight redness on the outside tegument of the nose probably proceeds
      from cold, or most likely heat. Try a little <i>poudre des fées</i> (see
      advertisement, p. 9).&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shy Susy.&mdash;It is impossible to answer inquiries in this column in
      less than a month. (1) If your tooth continues to ache, why not go to Mr.
      Hiram P. Prosser, American Dental Surgeon (see advertisement, p. 8), and
      have it out. (2) The best volume on Etiquette is by the Countess of D. It
      is entitled &lsquo;How to Behave&rsquo; (see advertisement outside cover). (3) No; to
      change hats in the train does not imply a promise to marry. It would,
      however, tell against the defendant in the witness-box. (4) Decidedly not;
      you should not allow a complete stranger to see you to your door, unless
      he is exceptionally good-looking. (5) Patchouli is the most fashionable
      scent.&rdquo;

      I do not suppose that this enterprising young woman is an honoured guest
      at the annual meeting of the British Medical Association. Certainly no
      lady superintendent of the health columns of a halfpenny weekly paper was
      pointed out to me at the one meeting of this body which I had the
      privilege of attending, and at which, by the way, some rather amusing
      incidents occurred.
    </p>
    <p>
      An annual, meeting of the British Medical Association seemed to me to be a
      delightful function. For some days there were <i>fêtes</i> (with
      fireworks), receptions (with military bands playing), dances (with that
      exhilarating champagne that comes from the Saumur districts), excursions
      to neighbouring ruins of historic interest, and the common or garden-party
      in abundance. In addition to all these, a rumour was circulated that
      papers were being read in some out-of-the-way hall&mdash;no one seemed to
      know where it was situated, and the report was generally regarded as a
      hoax&mdash;on modern therapeutics, for the entertainment of such visitors
      as might be interested in the progress of medical science.
    </p>
    <p>
      No one seemed interested in that particular line.
    </p>
    <p>
      A concert took place one evening, and was largely attended, every seat in
      the building being occupied. The local amateur tenor&mdash;the microbe of
      this malady has not yet been discovered&mdash;sang with his accustomed
      throaty incorrectness, and immediately afterwards there was a considerable
      interval. Then the conductor appeared upon the platform and said that an
      unfortunate accident had happened to the gentleman who had just sung, and
      he should feel greatly obliged if any medical gentleman who might chance
      to be present would kindly come round to the retiring room.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed to me that the audience rose <i>en masse</i> and trooped round
      to the retiring room. I was one of the few persons who remained in the
      hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, why didn&rsquo;t some strong man throw himself between the audience and
      the door?&rdquo; a stranger shouted across the hall to me in an American accent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With what object?&rdquo; I shouted back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal,&rdquo; said the stranger, &ldquo;I opine that if this community is subject to
      such visitations as we have just had from that gentleman who sang last,
      his destruction should be made a municipal affair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We know what we&rsquo;re about,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;How would you like to look up and
      find two hundred and forty-seven fully qualified medical men standing by
      your bed-side.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not much,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder if the story of the opossum that was up a gum tree, and begged a
      military man beneath not to fire, as he would come down, had reached the
      States before you left,&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      He said he hadn&rsquo;t heard tell of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;there was an opossum&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But here the hall began to refill, and the concert was proceeded with. The
      sufferer had recovered, we heard, in spite of all that was against him. A
      humorist said that he had merely slipped from a ladder in endeavouring to
      reach down his high C.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he was told that he had to pay two hundred and forty-seven guineas
      for medical attendance he nearly had a relapse.
    </p>
    <p>

    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      It was at the same meeting of the Medical Association that a garden-party
      was given by the Superintendent of the District Lunatic Asylum. This was a
      very pleasant affair, and was attended by about five hundred persons. A
      detestable man who was present, however, thought fit to make an effort to
      give additional spirit to the entertainment by pointing out to some of his
      friends the short, ungainly figure of a German <i>savant</i>, who was
      wandering about the grounds in a condition of loneliness, and by telling a
      story of a homicide of a bloodcurdling type, to account for the
      gentleman&rsquo;s presence at the institution.
    </p>
    <p>
      The jester gave free expression to his doubts as to the wisdom of the
      course adopted by the medical superintendent in permitting such freedom to
      a man who was supposed to be confined during Her Majesty&rsquo;s pleasure,&mdash;this
      was, he said, because of the merciful view taken by the jury before whom
      he had been tried. He added, however, that he supposed the superintendent
      knew his own business.
    </p>
    <p>
      As this story circulated freely, the German doctor, whose appearance and
      dress undoubtedly lent it a certain plausibility, became easily the most
      attractive person in view. Young men and maidens paused in the act of
      &ldquo;service&rdquo; over the lawn tennis nets, to watch the little man whose large
      eyes stared at them from beneath a pair of shaggy eyebrows, and whose
      ill-cut grey frieze coat suggested the uniform of the Hospital for the
      Insane. Strong men grasped their walking sticks more firmly as he passed,
      and women, well gowned, and wearing picture hats&mdash;I trust I am not
      infringing the copyright of the lady journalist&mdash;drew back, but still
      gazed at him with all the interest that attaches itself to a great
      criminal in the eyes of women.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little man could not but feel that he was attracting a great deal of
      attention; but being probably well aware of his own attainments, he did
      not shrink from any gaze, but smiled complacently on every side. Then a
      local medical man, whose self-confidence had never been known to fail him
      in an emergency, thought that the moment was an auspicious one for
      exhibiting the extent of his researches in cerebral phenomena, beckoned
      the German to his side, and, removing the man&rsquo;s hat, began to prove to the
      bystanders that the shape of his head was such as precluded the
      possibility of his playing any other part in the world but that of a
      distinguished homicide. But the German, who understood English very well,
      as he did everything else, turned at this point upon the local
      practitioner and asked him what the teuffil he meant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be alarmed, ladies,&rdquo; said the practitioner assuringly, as there was
      a movement among his audience. &ldquo;I know how to treat this form of
      aberration. Now then, my good man&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But at this moment a late arrival in the form of a great London surgeon
      strolled up accompanied by the medical superintendent of the Asylum, and
      with an exclamation of pleasure, pounced upon the subject of the discourse
      and shook him warmly by the hand. The Teuton was, however, by no means
      disposed to overlook the insult offered to him. He explained in the
      expressive German tongue what had occurred, and any one could see that he
      was greatly excited.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Sir Gregory, the English surgeon, had probably some experience of
      cases like this. He put his hand through the arm of the German, and then
      giving a laugh that in an emergency might obviate the use of a lancet, he
      said loudly enough to be heard over a considerable area,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come along, my dear friend; there is no visiting an hospital for the
      insane without coming across a lunatic,&mdash;a medical practitioner
      without discretion is worse.&rdquo;

      The local physician was left standing alone on the lawn.

    <p>
      He shortly afterwards went home.

      At the same meeting it was my privilege to be presented to a really great
      London physician. He was the medical gentleman who was consulted by a
      special correspondent on his return from making a tour with the Marquis of
      Lome, when the latter became Viceroy of Canada. The special correspondent
      had left for Canada on the very day that he arrived in England from the
      Cape, having gone through the Zulu campaign, and he had reached the Cape
      direct from the Afghan war. After about two years of these experiences he
      felt run down, and acting on the suggestion of a friend, lost no time in
      consulting the great physician.
    </p>
    <p>
      On learning that the man was suffering from a curious impression of
      weariness for which he could not account, but which he had tried in vain
      to shake off, the great physician asked him what was his profession. He
      replied that he was a literary man&mdash;that he wrote for a newspaper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, I thought so,&rdquo; cried the great physician. &ldquo;Your complaint is easily
      accounted for. I perceived in a moment that you had been leading a
      sedentary life. That is what plays havoc with literary men. What you need
      just now is a complete change&mdash;no half measures, mind you&mdash;a
      complete change&mdash;a sea voyage would brace you up, or,&mdash;let me
      see&mdash;ah, yes, Margate might do. Try a fortnight at Margate.&rdquo;

      I am bound to say that it was another doctor who, when a naval captain who
      had been in charge of a corvette on the South Pacific station for five
      years, went to him for advice, gravely remarked,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder, sir, if at any time of your life you got a severe wetting?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The modern physician is most earnest in recommending changes of air and
      scene and employment. He is an enemy to the drug system. But the last
      enemy that shall be destroyed is the drug system. The &ldquo;masses&rdquo; believe in
      it as they believe no other system, whether in medicine, religion, or even
      gambling.
    </p>
    <p>
      I shall never forget the ring of contempt that there was in the voice of a
      servant of mine at the Cape, when, on the army surgeon&rsquo;s giving him a
      prescription to be made up, he found that the whole thing only cost
      fourpence, and he said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That there coor can&rsquo;t be much of a coor, sir; only corst fourpence, and
      me ready to pay &lsquo;arf-a-crown.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the smoking-room of an hotel in Liverpool some years ago a rather
      self-assertive gentleman was dilating to a group in a cosy corner on the
      advantages of travel, not merely as a physical, but as an intellectual
      stimulant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I right, sir?&rdquo; he cried, turning to me. &ldquo;Have you ever travelled?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I mentioned that I had done a little in that way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where do you come from now, sir?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;South America,&rdquo; said I meekly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you, sir,&rdquo; he cried, turning to another stranger; &ldquo;have you
      travelled?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, a bit,&rdquo; replied the man. &ldquo;I was in &lsquo;Frisco this day fortnight, and
      I&rsquo;ll be in Egypt on this day week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew by the look of those gentlemen that they had travelled,&rdquo; said the
      loud man, turning to his group. &ldquo;I believe in the value of travel. I
      travel myself&mdash;just like those gentlemen. Yes; a week ago I was at
      Bradford. Here I am at Liverpool to-day, and Heaven knows where I may be
      next week&mdash;at Manchester, may be.&rdquo;

    <p>
      So far as I can gather, the impression seems to be pretty general that
      some divergence of opinion is by no means impossible among physicians in
      their diagnosis of a case. Doctors themselves seem to have at last become
      aware of the fact that the possibility of a difference being manifested in
      their views on some cases is now and again commented on by the
      irresponsible layman. An eminent member of that profession which makes a
      larger demand than any other upon the patience, the judgment, and the
      self-sacrifice of those who practise it, defended, a short time ago, in
      the course of a very witty speech, the apparent want of harmony between
      the views of physicians on some technical points. He said that perhaps he
      might not be going too far if he remarked that occasionally in a court of
      law the technical evidence given by two doctors seemed at first sight not
      to agree. This point was readily conceded by the audience; and the
      professor then went on to say that surely the absence of this mechanical
      agreement on all points should be accepted as powerful testimony to the
      conscientiousness of the profession. One of the rarest of charges brought
      against physicians was that of collusion. In fact, while he believed that,
      if put to it, his memory would be quite equal to recall some instances of
      a divergence of opinion between doctors in a witness-box, he did not think
      that he could remember a single case in which a charge of collusion
      against two members of the profession had been brought home to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most sensible people will, I am persuaded, take this view of a matter
      which has called for comment in all ages. It is because doctors are so
      singularly sensitive that, sooner than run the chance of being accused of
      acting in collusion in any case, they now and again have been known to
      express views that were&mdash;well, not absolutely in harmony the one with
      the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      The distinguished physician who made so reasonable a defence of the
      profession which he adorns, told me that it was one of his early
      instructors who made that excellent summary of the relative values of
      medical attendance:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no hesitation in saying that it&rsquo;s not better to be attended by a
      good doctor than a bad doctor; but I won&rsquo;t go the length of saying that
      it&rsquo;s not better to be attended by no doctor at all than by either.&rdquo;

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE annual meetings
      of the British Association for the Advancement of Science can be made
      quite as delightful functions as those of the British Medical Association,
      if they are not taken too seriously; and I don&rsquo;t think that there is much
      likelihood of that happening. I have had the privilege of taking part in
      several of the dances, the garden parties, and the concerts which have
      taken place under the grateful protection of science. I have also availed
      myself of the courtesy of the railway companies that issued cheap tickets
      to the various places of interest in the locality where the annual
      festivities took place under the patronage of the British Association. The
      only President&rsquo;s address which I ever heard delivered was, however, that
      of Professor Tyndall at Belfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was little more than a boy at the time, and that is probably why I was
      more deeply interested in Biology and Evolution than I have been in more
      recent years. It is scarcely necessary to say that Professor Tyndall&rsquo;s
      utterance would take a very humble place in the heterodoxy of the present
      day, for the exponents of theology have found it necessary to enlarge
      their borders as the century draws to a close, and I suppose that if poor
      Tyndall had offered to lecture in St. Paul&rsquo;s Cathedral his appearance
      under the dome would have been welcomed by the authorities, as it
      certainly would have been by the public. But Belfast had for long been the
      centre of strict orthodoxy, and so soon as the address of Professor
      Tyndall was printed a great cry arose from every pulpit. The excellent
      Presbyterians of Ulster were astounded at the audacity of the man in
      coming into the midst of such a community as theirs in order to deliver an
      address that breathed of something worse than the ancient atheists had
      ever dreamed of in their most heterodox moments. If the man had wanted to
      blaspheme&mdash;and a good <i>primâ facie</i> case was made out in favour
      of the assumption that he had&mdash;could he not have taken himself off to
      some congenial locality for the purpose? Why should he come to Belfast
      with such an object? Would the town ever get rid of the stigma that would
      certainly be attached to it as the centre from which the blasphemies of
      Biology had radiated upon this occasion?
    </p>
    <p>
      These were the questions that afflicted the good people for many days, and
      the consensus of opinion seemed to be in favour of the theory that unless
      the town should undergo a sort of moral fumigation, it would not be
      restored to the position it had previously occupied in the eyes of
      Christendom. The general idea is that to slaughter a pig in a Mohammedan
      mosque is an act the consequences of which are so far-reaching as to be
      practically irreparable; the act of Professor Tyndall at Belfast was of
      precisely this nature in the estimation of the inhabitants.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortunately, however, a champion of orthodoxy appeared in the form of a
      Professor at the Presbyterian College who wrote a book&mdash;I believe
      some copies may still be purchased&mdash;to make it impossible for Tyndall
      or any other exponent of Evolution to face an audience of intelligent
      people. This book was the saving of the town. Belfast was rehabilitated,
      and the people breathed again.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the years went by; Darwin&rsquo;s funeral service was held in Westminster
      Abbey, and Professor Tyndall&rsquo;s voice was now and again heard like an
      Alpine echo of his master. In Belfast a University Extension Scheme was
      set on foot and promised to be a brilliant success&mdash;it collapsed
      after a time, but that is not to the point. What is to the point, however,
      is the fact that the inaugural lecture of the University Extension series
      was on the subject of Biology, and the chosen exponent of the science was
      Professor Tyndall. He came to Belfast as the honoured guest of the city&mdash;it
      had become a city since his memorable visit&mdash;and he passed some days
      at the official residence of the Presbyterian President of the Queen&rsquo;s
      College, who had been a pupil at the divinity school of the clergyman who
      had written the book that was supposed to have re-consecrated, as it were,
      the locality defiled by the British Association address of 1874.
    </p>
    <p>
      This incident appears to me to be noteworthy&mdash;almost as noteworthy as
      the reception given in honour of Monsieur Emile Zola in the Guildhall a
      few years after Mr. Vizetelly had been sent to gaol for issuing a purified
      translation of a work of Zola&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think it was Mr. Forster who, in the spring of 1882, when Mr. Parnell
      and his friends were languishing in Kilmainham, said that the Irish
      Channel was like the water described by Byron: a palace at one side, a
      prison on the other. The Irish members left Kilmainham, and in a few hours
      found themselves in Westminster Palace&mdash;at least, Westminster Palace
      Hotel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Public opinion knows but the two places of residence&mdash;a palace and a
      prison. When a man leaves the one he is considered fit for the other.
      Public opinion knows but black and white, and vacillates from one to the
      other with the utmost regularity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only constant thing in the world is change.

    <p>
      At another meeting of the British Association I was a witness of a
      remarkable piece of cleverness on the part of a young man who has since
      proved his claim to be regarded as one of the most adroit men in England.
      Among the excursions the chief was to the locality of a ruin, the origin
      of which was, like the origin of the De la Pluche family, lost in the
      mists of obscurity. The ruin had been frequently visited by distinguished
      archæologists, but none had ventured to do more than guess&mdash;if one
      could imagine guesswork and archaeology associated&mdash;what period
      should be assigned to the dilapidated towers. It so happened, however,
      that an elderly professor at the local college had, by living laborious
      days, and mastering the elements of a new language, succeeded in wresting
      their secret from the lichened stones, and he made up his mind that when
      the British Association had its excursion to the ruin, he would reveal all
      that he had discovered regarding it, and by this <i>coup de théâtre</i>
      become famous.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the clever young man had an interesting young brother who had gained a
      reputation as a poet, and who dressed perhaps a trifle in excess of this
      reputation; and when the old professor was about to make his revelation
      regarding the ruin, the clever young man put up his brother in another
      part of the enclosure to recite one of his own poems on the locality. In a
      few moments the professor, who had commenced his discourse, was
      practically deserted. Only half a dozen of the excursionists rallied round
      him, and permitted themselves to be mystified; the cream of the visitors,
      to the number of perhaps a hundred, were around the reciter on an historic
      hillock fifty yards away, and his mellow cadences sounded very alluring to
      the few people who listened to the jerky delivery of the lecturer in the
      ruin.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the clever young man did not yield to the alluring voice of his
      brother. He had heard that voice before, and was well acquainted with its
      cadences. He was also well acquainted with the poem that was being recited&mdash;he
      had heard it more than once before. What he was not acquainted with was
      the marvellous discovery made by the professor who was in the act of
      revealing it to ten ears&mdash;that is allowing that only one person of
      those around him was deaf. The clever young man sat concealed behind a
      wall covered with ivy and listened to every word of the revelation. When
      it was over he unostentatiously joined the crowd around his brother, and
      heard with pleasure that the delivery of the poem had been very striking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we must not waste our time,&rdquo; said the clever young man, with the air
      of authority of a personal conductor. &ldquo;We have several other interesting
      points to dwell upon&rdquo;&mdash;he spoke as if he and his brother owned the
      ruins and the natural landscape into the bargain. &ldquo;Oh, yes, we must hurry
      on. I do not suppose there is any lady or gentleman present who is aware
      of the fact that we are within a few yards of the place where the
      great-grandfather of Queen Boadicea lies buried.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A murmur of negation passed round the crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Follow me,&rdquo; said the clever young man; and they followed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He led them to the very place where the professor had made his revelation,
      and then, standing on a portion of the ruined structure, he gave in choice
      language, and with many inspiring quotations from the literature of the
      Ancient Britons, the substance of the professor&rsquo;s revelation.
    </p>
    <p>
      For half an hour he continued his discourse, and quite delighted every one
      who heard him, except, perhaps, the elderly professor. He was among the
      audience, and he listened, with staring eyes, to the clever young man&rsquo;s
      delightful mingling of the deepest archaeological facts with fictions that
      had a semblance of truth, and he was speechless. The innocent old soul
      actually believed that the clever young man had surpassed him, the
      professor, in the profundity of his researches into the history of the
      ruin; he knew that the face of the clever young man had not been among the
      faces of the few people who had heard his revelation, but he did not know
      that the clever young man was hidden among the ivy a few yards away.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the people were applauding the delightful discourse, he pressed
      forward to the impromptu lecturer and shook him warmly by the hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;you have in you the stuff that goes to make a great
      archæologist. I have worked at nothing else but this ruin for the last
      eight years, and yet I admit that you know more about it than I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my dear sir,&rdquo; said the clever young man, &ldquo;the world knows that in
      your own path you are without a rival. I am content to sit at your feet.
      It is an honourable position. Any time you want to know something of this
      locality and its archæology do not hesitate to command me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The only rival in adroitness to the young man whose feats I have just
      recorded was one Antonio Giuseppe. I came upon this person in London, but
      only when I was in Milan did I become acquainted with the extent of his
      capacity. One of the stories I heard about him is, I think, worth
      repeating, illustrating, as it does, the difference between the English
      and the Italian systems of imposture.
    </p>
    <p>
      Antonio Giuseppe certainly was attached to the State Opera Company, but it
      would be difficult to define with any degree of exactness his duties in
      connection with that Institution. He had got not a single note in his
      voice, and yet&mdash;nay, on this account&mdash;he had passed during a
      season at Homburg as a distinguished tenor&mdash;for Signor Giuseppe was
      careful to see that his portmanteau was inscribed in white letters of
      considerable size, &ldquo;Signor Antonio Giuseppe, State Opera Company.&rdquo; He gave
      himself as many airs as a professional&mdash;nay, as an amateur, tenor,
      and he was thus assigned the most select apartment in the hotel during his
      sojourn, and a large folding screen was placed between his seat at the <i>table
      d&rsquo;hote</i> and the window. There was, indeed, every excuse for taking
      Signor Giuseppe for a distinguished operatic tenor. He spoke all European
      languages with equal impurity, he went about in a waistcoat that
      resembled, in combination of colours, the drop scene of a theatre, he wore
      a blue velvet tie, made up in a knot to display a carbuncle pin about the
      size of a tram-car light, and his generosity in wristband was equalled
      only by his prodigality of cigarette paper. These characteristics, coupled
      with the fact that he had never been known to indulge in the luxury of a
      bath, gave rise to the rumour that he was the greatest tenor in Europe;
      consequently he was looked upon with envy by the Dukes with incomes of a
      thousand pounds a day, who were accustomed to resort for some months out
      of the year to Homburg; while Countesses in their own right sent him daily
      missives expressive of their admiration for his talents, and entreating
      the favour of his autograph in their birthday books. Poor Signor Giuseppe
      was greatly perplexed by the arrival of a birthday book at his apartment
      every morning; but so soon as its import was explained to him, he never
      failed to respond to the request of the fair owners of the volumes. His
      caligraphy did not extend beyond the limits of his autograph, and his
      birthday seemed to be with him a movable feast, for in no two of the books
      did his name appear on the pages assigned to the same month. As a matter
      of fact, it is almost impossible for a man who has never been acquainted
      with his father or mother, to know with any degree of accuracy the exact
      day on which he was born, so that Signor Giuseppe, who was discovered by a
      priest in a shed at the quay at Leghorn on St. Joseph&rsquo;s day, was not to
      blame for his ignorance in respect of his nativity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, when Mr. Fitzgauntlet, the enterprising impresario of the State
      Opera, turned up at Homburg in the course of a week or two, it became
      known that whatever position Signor Giuseppe might occupy in the State
      Opera Company, it was not that of <i>primo tenore</i>, for the most
      exacting impresario has never been known to include among the duties of a
      <i>primo tenore</i> the unpacking of a portmanteau and the arrangement of
      its contents around the dressing room of the impresario. The folding
      screen was removed from behind Signor Giuseppe on the day following the
      arrival of Mr. Fitzgauntlet at Homburg, and from being <i>feted</i> as
      Giuseppe the tenor, he was scorned as Giuseppe the valet.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in regarding Signor Giuseppe as nothing beyond the valet to the
      impresario the sojourners at the hotel were as greatly in error as in
      accepting him as the tenor. To be sure Signor Giuseppe now and again
      discharged the duties that usually devolve upon the valet, but the scope
      of his duties extended far beyond these limits. It was his task to arrange
      the <i>claque</i> for a new <i>prima donna</i>, and to purchase the
      bouquets to be showered upon the stage when the impresario was anxious to
      impress upon the public the admirable qualities possessed by a <i>débutante</i>
      whose services he had secured for a trifle. It was also Giuseppe&rsquo;s
      privilege to receive the bouquets left at the stage door by the young
      gentlemen&mdash;or the old gentlemen&mdash;who had become struck with the
      graceful figure of the <i>premiere danseuse</i> or perhaps <i>cinquantième
      danseuse</i>, and the emoluments arising from this portion of his duties
      were said to be equal to a liberal income, exclusive of what he made by
      the disposal of the bouquets to the florist from whom they had been
      originally purchased. This invaluable official also made a little money
      for himself by his ingenuity in obtaining the photographs and autographs
      of the chief artists of the company, which he distributed for sale every
      evening in the stalls; but not quite so profitable was that part of his
      business which consisted in inventing stories to account for the absence
      of the impresario when tradesmen called at the State theatre with their
      bills; still, the thoughtfulness and ingenuity of Signor Giuseppe were
      quite equal to the strain put upon them in this direction, and Mr.
      Fitzgauntlet had no reason to be otherwise than satisfied. When it is
      understood that Giuseppe transacted nearly all their business for the
      chief artists in the company, engaged their apartments, and looked after
      their luggage when on tour in the provinces, it will readily be believed
      that he had, as a rule, more money at his banker&rsquo;s than any official
      connected with the State Opera.
    </p>
    <p>
      The confidence which had always been placed in Signor Giuseppe&rsquo;s integrity
      by the artists of the company was upon one occasion rudely shaken, and the
      story of how this disaster occurred is about to be related. Signor
      Giuseppe did a little business in wine and cigars, principally of British
      manufacture, and he had, with his accustomed dexterity, hitherto escaped a
      criminal prosecution under the Sale of Drugs Act for the consequences of
      his success in disposing of his commodities in this line of business. He
      also did a little in a medical way, a certain bottle containing a bright
      crimson liquid with a horrible taste being extremely popular among the
      members of the extensive chorus of the State Opera. When a &ldquo;cyclus&rdquo; of
      modern German opera was contemplated by Mr. Fitzgauntlet, Giuseppe
      increased his medical stock, feeling sure that the result of the
      performances would occasion a run upon his drugs; but the negotiations
      fell through, and it was only by the force of his perseverance and
      persuasiveness he contrived to get rid of his surplus to the gentlemen who
      played the brass instruments in the orchestra. It was not, however, on
      account of his transactions in the medical way that he almost forfeited
      the respect in which he was held by the artists, but because of the part
      he played with regard to the disposal of a certain box of cigars. After
      the production of the opera <i>Le Diamant Noir</i>, Signor Boccalione, the
      great basso, went to Giuseppe, saying,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Giuseppe, I want your advice: you know I have made the success of the
      opera, but I do not read music very quickly, and Monsieur Lejeune has had
      a good deal of trouble with me. I should like to make him some little
      return; what would you suggest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Giuseppe was lost in thought. He wondered, could he suggest the propriety
      of the basso&rsquo;s offering the <i>maestro di piano</i> a case of Burgundy&mdash;Giuseppe
      had just received three cases of the finest Burgundy that had ever been
      made in the Minories.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A present to the value of how much?&rdquo; he asked of Signor Boccalione.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said the basso airily, and with a gesture of indifference, &ldquo;about
      sixty francs. Monsieur Lejeune had not really so much trouble with me&mdash;no
      one else in the company would think of acknowledging his services, but
      with me it is different&mdash;I cannot live without being generous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Giuseppe mused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the signor would only go so far as seventy francs, I could get him a
      box of the choicest cigars,&rdquo; he said after a pause; and then he went on to
      explain that the cigars were in the possession of a friend of his own,
      whom he had passed into the opera one night, and who consequently owed him
      some compliment, so that the box, which in the ordinary way of business
      was really worth eighty francs, might be obtained for seventy. The
      generosity of the basso, however, was not without its limits; it would,
      sustain the tension put upon it by the expenditure of sixty francs, but it
      was not sufficiently strong to face the outlay suggested by Giuseppe..
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sixty francs!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;sixty francs is a small fortune, and I myself
      smoke excellent cigars at thirty. I will give no more than sixty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Giuseppe did not think the box could be purchased for the money, but he
      said he would try and induce his friend to be liberal. The next day he
      came to Signor Boccalione with the box containing the hundred cigars of
      the choicest brand&mdash;the quality of the cigars will be fully
      appreciated when it is understood that the hundred cost Giuseppe
      originally close upon thirteen shillings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Per Bacco!&rdquo; cried the basso, &ldquo;Monsieur Lejeune should be a happy man&mdash;he
      had hardly any trouble with me, now that I come to reflect. Oh, I am the
      only man in the company who would be so foolish as to think of a present&mdash;and
      such a present&mdash;for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Signor!&rdquo; said Giuseppe, &ldquo;such a present! The perfume, signor,
      wonderful! delicious! celestial!&rdquo; He then explained how he had persuaded
      his friend, by soft words and promises, to part with the box for sixty
      francs, and Signor Boccalione listened and laughed; then, on a sheet of
      pink notepaper, the basso wrote a dedication, occupying twelve lines, of
      the box of cigars to the use of the supremely illustrious <i>maestro di
      piano</i>, Lejeune, in token of the invaluable assistance he had afforded
      to the most humble and grateful of his friends and servants, Alessandro
      Boccalione.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Giuseppe promised to send the box to the maestro on the following day
      he meant to keep his word, and he did keep it. On the same evening he was
      met by Maestro Lejeune. The maestro looked very pale in the face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Giuseppe, my friend,&rdquo; he said with a smile, &ldquo;you were very good to me
      upon our last tour, looking after my luggage with commendable zeal; I have
      often thought of making you some little return. You will find a box of
      cigars&mdash;one hundred all but one&mdash;on my dressing table; you may
      have them for your own use.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Giuseppe was profuse in his thanks, and, on going to the dressing-room of
      the maestro, obtained possession once more of the box of cigars he had
      sold to the basso. On the mat was the half-smoked sample which Monsieur
      Lejeune had attempted to get through.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not more than a week had passed after this transaction when Signor
      Giuseppe was sent for by Madame Speranza, the celebrated soprano.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Giuseppe,&rdquo; said the lady, &ldquo;as you have had twenty-seven of my photographs
      within the past month, I think you may be able to help me out of a
      difficulty in which I find myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Giuseppe thought it rather ungenerous for a soprano earning&mdash;or at
      least getting paid&mdash;two hundred pounds a week, to make any reference
      to such a paltry matter as photographs; he, however, said nothing on this
      subject, but only expressed his willingness to serve the lady. She then
      explained to him what he knew already, namely, that she had had a serious
      difference with Herr Groschen, the conductor, as to the <i>tempo</i> of a
      certain air in <i>Le Diamant Noir</i>, and that the conductor and she had
      not been on speaking terms for more than a fortnight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But now,&rdquo; said Madame Speranza in conclusion, &ldquo;now that I have made the
      opera so brilliant a success, I should like to make my peace with the poor
      old man, who must be miserable in consequence of my treatment of him,&mdash;especially
      as I got the best of the dispute. I mean to write to him this evening, and
      send him some present&mdash;something small, you know&mdash;not
      extravagant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What would Madame think of the appropriateness of a box of cigars?&rdquo; asked
      Giuseppe after an interval of thought. &ldquo;I heard Herr Groschen say that he
      had just smoked the last of a box, and meant to purchase another when he
      had the money,&rdquo; he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much would a box of cigars cost?&rdquo; asked the <i>prima donna</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame can have cigars at all prices&mdash;even as low as sixty-five
      francs,&rdquo; replied her confidential adviser.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mon Dieu! what extravagant creatures men are!&rdquo; cried the lady.
      &ldquo;Sixty-five francs&rsquo; worth of cigars would probably not last him more than
      a few months. Never mind; I do not want a cheap box,&mdash;my soul is a
      generous one: procure me a box at sixty-six francs, and we will say
      nothing more about the photographs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Signor Giuseppe said he would try what could be done. A man whom he had
      once obliged had a sister married to one of the most intelligent cigar
      merchants in the city; but he did not think he had any cigars under
      seventy francs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a sou more than sixty-six will I pay,&rdquo; cried the soprano with
      emphasis. Giuseppe gave a shrug and said he would see what could be done.
    </p>
    <p>
      What he saw could be done was to expend the sum of twopence English in the
      purchase of a cigar, to put in the centre of the package from which the
      maestro had taken his sample, and to bring the box sealed to Madame
      Speranza, whom he congratulated on being able to present her late enemy
      with a box of cigars of a quality not to be surpassed in the island of
      Cuba. The lady put her face down to the box and made a little grimace, and
      Giuseppe left her apartment with three guineas English in his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two days afterwards he encountered Herr Groschen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Giuseppe,&rdquo; said the conductor, &ldquo;you may remember that when you so
      cleverly contrived to have my luggage with the fifteen pounds of tobacco
      amongst it passed at the Custom House I said I would make you a present.
      Forgive me for my negligence all this time, and accept a box of choice
      cigars, which you will find on my table. May you be happy, Giuseppe&mdash;you
      are a worthy fellow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It is needless to say that Signor Giuseppe recovered his box. On the
      hearth-rug lay a half-smoked specimen, and by its side the portion of
      Madame Speranza&rsquo;s letter to the conductor which he had used to light the
      one cigar out of the hundred.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before another week had passed, the same box had been sold to the tenor,
      to present to Mr. Fitzgauntlet, who, on receiving it, put his nose down to
      the package, and threw the lot into a corner among waste papers, and went
      on with his writing. The box was rescued by Giuseppe, and presented by him
      to the husband of Madame Galatini-Purissi, the contralto, in exchange for
      three dozen copies of the fair <i>artiste&rsquo;s</i> portrait. Then Signor
      Purissi sent the box to the flautist in the orchestra, who played the
      obbligato to some of the contralto&rsquo;s arias, and as this gentleman did not
      smoke he made it over once more to Signor Giuseppe. As the box had by this
      time been in the hands of every one in the company likely to possess a box
      of cigars, Giuseppe thought it would show a grasping spirit on his part
      were he to attempt to dispose of it again; so he merely made up the
      ninety-nine cigars in packages of three, which he sold to thirty-three
      members of the chorus at a shilling a head.
    </p>
    <p>
      It so happened, however, that Herr Groschen, Signor Boccalione, and Signor
      Purissi met in a tobacconist&rsquo;s shop about a week after the final
      distribution of the cigars, and their conversation turned upon the
      comparative ease with which bad cigars could be procured. Herr Groschen
      boasted how he had repaid his obligations to Giuseppe with a box of
      cigars, which he was certain satisfied the poor devil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Corpo di Bacco!&rdquo; cried the basso, &ldquo;I bought a box from Giuseppe to
      present to Maestro Lejeune.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I,&rdquo; said the husband of the contralto, &ldquo;bought another from him. Can
      it have been the same box?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Suspicion being thus aroused, Boccalione sought out Monsieur Lejeune, who
      confessed that he had given the box to Giuseppe; and Signor Purissi
      learned from the flautist that his gift had been disposed of in the same
      direction. The story went round the company, and poor Giuseppe was pounced
      upon by his indignant and demonstrative countrymen, and an explanation
      demanded of him on the subject of his repeated disposal of the same box.
      Giuseppe was quite as demonstrative as the most earnest of his
      interrogators in declaring that he had not disposed of the same box. His
      friend had obliged him with several boxes, and he had himself been greatly
      put about to oblige the ungrateful people who now turned upon him. He
      swore by the tomb of his parents that the obligations he had already
      discharged towards the ingrates would never be repeated; they might in
      future go elsewhere (Signor Giuseppe made a suggestion as to the exact
      locality) for their cigars; but for his part he washed his hands clean of
      them and their cigars. For three-quarters of an hour the basso-profundo,
      the soprano, and the husband of the contralto gesticulated before Giuseppe
      in the portico of the Opera House, until a crowd collected, the impression
      being general that an animated scene from a new opera was being rehearsed
      by the artists of the State Opera. A policeman who arrived on the scene
      could not be persuaded to take this view of the matter, and he politely
      requested the distinguished members of the State Opera Company either to
      move on or to go within the precincts of the building. The basso attempted
      to explain to the policeman in very choice Italian what Giuseppe had done,
      but he was so demonstrative the officer thought he was threatening the
      police force generally, and took his name and address with a view to
      issuing a summons for this offence. In the meantime Giuseppe got into a
      hansom and drove off, craning his neck round the side of the vehicle to
      make a parting allusion to the maternity of the husband of the contralto,
      to which the soprano promptly replied by a suggestion which, if true,
      would tend to remove the mystery surrounding the origin of Giuseppe. A
      week afterwards of course all were once again on the most friendly terms;
      but Giuseppe now and again feels that his want of ingenuousness in the
      cigar-box transaction well-nigh jeopardised the reputation for integrity
      he had previously enjoyed among the principals of the State Opera Company.
      He has been much more careful ever since, and flatters himself that not
      even the <i>tenore robusto</i>, who is the most suspicious of men, can
      discover the points on which he gets the better of him. As a practical
      financier Signor Antonio Giuseppe thinks of himself as a success; and
      there can hardly be a doubt that he is fully justified in taking such a
      view of his career.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>F this chapter is
      a short one, it is so for the best of reasons: it is meant to record some
      blunders of printers and others which impressed themselves upon me. It
      would obviously be impossible to make a chapter of the average length out
      of such a record. The really humorous faults in the setting up of anything
      I have ever written have been very few. In the printing of the original
      edition of my novel <i>Daireen</i> one of the most notable occurred in a
      first proof. Every chapter of this book is headed with a few lines from <i>Hamlet</i>,
      and one of these headings is from the well-known scene with Rosencrantz
      and Guildenstern,
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      <i>Gull</i>.&mdash;The King, sir&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      <i>Hamlet</i>.&mdash;Ay, sir, what of him?
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      <i>Gull</i>.&mdash;Is in his retirement marvellous distempered.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      <i>Hamlet</i>.&mdash;With drink, sir?
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      <i>Gull</i>.&mdash;No, my lord, rather with choler.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the dialogue as I had written it. The humorous printer added a
      letter that somewhat changed the sense. He made the line,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;No, my lord, rather with <i>cholera</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      This was probably an honest attempt on the compositor&rsquo;s part to work out a
      &ldquo;new reading,&rdquo; and it certainly did not appear to me to be more
      extravagant than the scores of attempts made in the same direction. If
      this reading were accepted, the perturbation of Claudius during the
      players&rsquo; scene, and his hasty Bight before its conclusion, would be
      accounted for.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another daring new reading in <i>Hamlet</i> was suggested by a compositor,
      through the medium of a comma and a capital. In the course of a magazine
      article, he set up a line in the third scene of the third act, in this
      way,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      <i>Hamlet</i>.&mdash;Now might I do it, Pat!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      It is somewhat curious that some attempt has not been made before now to
      justify such a reading. Could it not be suggested that Hamlet had an Irish
      servant who was in his confidence? About the time of Hamlet, the Danes had
      an important settlement in Ireland, and why might not Hamlet&rsquo;s father have
      brought one of the natives of that island, named Patrick, to be the
      personal attendant of the young prince? The whole thing appears so
      feasible, it almost approaches the dimensions of an Irish grievance that
      no actor has yet had the courage to bring on the Irish servant who was
      clearly addressed by Hamlet in the words just quoted.
    </p>
    <p>
      So &ldquo;readings&rdquo; are made.
    </p>
    <p>
      Either of those which the compositors suggested is much more worthy of
      respect than the late Mr. Barry Sullivan&rsquo;s,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;I know a hawk from a heron. Pshaw!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      But if compositors are sometimes earnest and enterprising students of
      Shakespeare, I have sometimes found them deficient on the subject of
      geography. Upon one occasion, for instance, I accompanied a number of them
      on an excursion to the Isle of Man. The day was one of a mighty rushing
      wind, and the steamer being a small one, the disasters among the
      passengers were numerous. There was not a printer aboard who was not in a
      condition the technical equivalent to which is &ldquo;pie.&rdquo; I administered
      brandy to some of them, telling them to introduce a &ldquo;turned rule,&rdquo; which
      means, in newspaper instructions, &ldquo;more to follow.&rdquo; But all was of no
      avail. We reached the island in safety, however, and then one of the
      compositors who had been very much discomposed, seeing the train about to
      start for Douglas, told me in a confidential whisper that he had suffered
      so much on the voyage, he had made up his mind to return to Ireland by
      train.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Quite a new reading, not to <i>Hamlet</i>, but to one of the lyrics in <i>The
      Princess</i>, was suggested by another compositor. The introduction of a
      comma in the first line of the last stanza of &ldquo;Home they brought her
      warrior dead&rdquo; produced a quaint effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      &ldquo;Rose a nurse of ninety years,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Set his child upon her knee,&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      appears in every edition of <i>The Princess</i>. But my friend, by his
      timely insertion of a comma, made it read thus:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      &ldquo;Rose, a nurse of ninety years.&rdquo;
     </p>

      One of the loveliest of Irish national melodies is that for which Moore

    <p>
      The title of this song appeared in the programme of a St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day
      Concert, which was published in a leading London newspaper, as though the
      poem were addressed to one Mr. O&rsquo;Moyle,&mdash;&ldquo;Silent, O&rsquo;Moyle.&rdquo;

      Another humorist set up a reference to &ldquo;Susanna and the Elders,&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Susanna and the Editors,&rdquo; which was not just the same thing. Possibly the
      printer had another and equally apocryphal episode in his mind&rsquo;s eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      I felt a warm personal regard for the man who made a lecturer state that a
      critic had &ldquo;poured out the violets of his wrath upon him.&rdquo; The criticism
      did not, under these circumstances, seem particularly severe.
    </p>
    <p>
      I must frankly confess, however, that I had nothing but reprobation for
      the one who made a clergyman state in a lecture to a class of young
      ladies, that his favourite poem of Wordsworth&rsquo;s was &ldquo;Invitations to
      Immorality.&rdquo; Nor had I the least feeling except of indignation for the one
      who set up the title of a picture in which I was interested, &ldquo;a rare
      turnip,&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;a rare tulip.&rdquo; The printer who at the conclusion of
      an obituary notice was expected to announce to the readers of the paper
      that &ldquo;the interment will take place on Saturday,&rdquo; but who, instead, gave
      them to understand that &ldquo;the entertainment will take place on Saturday,&rdquo;
       did not, I think, cause any awkward mishap. He knew that the idea was that
      of entertainment, whatever the word employed might be.
    </p>
    <p>
      The compositor who caused an editor to refer to &ldquo;the autotype of the
      Russian people,&rdquo; when the word <i>autocrat</i> was in the &ldquo;copy&rdquo; before
      him, was less to be blamed than the reader who allowed such a mistake to
      pass without correction.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I read on a proof one night that the most striking scene in <i>The
      Dead Heart</i> at the Lyceum was &ldquo;the burning of the Pastille and the
      dance of the Rigmarole,&rdquo; I asked for the &ldquo;copy&rdquo; that had been telegraphed;
      and I found that the printer was not responsible for this marvellous
      blunder.

      It will be remembered that at one of his lectures in the United States,
      Mr. Richard A. Proctor remarked that in the course of a few million years
      something remarkable would happen, but that its occurrence would not
      inconvenience his audience, as he supposed they would all be in Paradise
      at that time.
    </p>
    <p>
      In one paper the reporter made him say that he supposed his audience would
      all be in Paris at that time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next evening Mr. Proctor turned the mistake to a good &ldquo;scoring&rdquo;
       account, by stating that he fancied at first an error had been made; but
      that shortly afterwards, he remembered that the tradition was, that all
      good Americans go to Paris when they die, so that the reporter clearly
      understood his business.

    <p>
      The enterprising correspondent who sows his telegrams broadcast is a
      frequent cause of the appearance of mistakes. I recollect that one sent a
      hundred words over the wire regarding some village concert, the great
      success of which was due to the zeal of the Reverend John Jones, &ldquo;the <i>locus
      standi</i> of the parish.&rdquo; He had probably heard something at one time of
      a <i>pastor loci,</i> and made a brave but unsuccessful attempt to
      reproduce the phrase.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another correspondent telegraphed regarding the arrival of two American
      cyclists at Queenstown, that their itinerary would be as follows: &ldquo;They
      will travel on their bicycles through Ireland and England, and then
      crossing from Dover to Calais they will proceed through Europe, and from
      Turkey they will pass through Asia Minor into Xenophon and the Anabasis,
      leaving which they will travel to Egypt and the Land of <i>Goschen</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The reference to Xenophon was funny enough, but the spelling of the last
      word, identifying the country with the statesman, seemed to me to
      represent the highwater mark of the flood-tide of modernism. A few years
      before, when the correspondent was doubtless more in touch with the
      vicissitudes of the Children of Israel than with the feats of cyclists
      from the United States, he would probably have assimilated Mr. Goschen&rsquo;s
      name with the Land of Goshen; but soon the fame of the ex-Chancellor of
      the Exchequer had become of more immediate importance to him, and it was
      the land that changed its name in his mind to the name of the ex-Finance
      Minister.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was probably the influence of the same spirit of modernism that caused
      a foreman, in making up the paper for the press, to insert under the title
      of &ldquo;Sporting,&rdquo; half a column of a report of a lecture by a clergyman on
      &ldquo;The Races of Palestine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      It was, however, the telegraph office that I found to be responsible for a
      singular error in the report of the arrest of a certain notorious
      criminal. The report should have stated that &ldquo;a photograph of the prisoner
      had been taken by the detective camera,&rdquo; but the result of the filtration
      of the message through a network of telegraph wires was the statement that
      the photograph &ldquo;had been taken by Detective Cameron.&rdquo;
     </p>

      Some years ago a too earnest naturalist was drowned when canoeing on a
      lake in the west of Ireland. An enterprising correspondent who clearly
      resided near the scene of the accident, forwarded to the newspaper with
      which I was connected, a circumstantial account of the finding of the
      capsized canoe. In the course of his references to the objects of the
      naturalist&rsquo;s visit to the west, the reporter made the astounding statement
      that &ldquo;he had already succeeded in getting together a practically complete
      collection of the <i>flora</i> and <i>fauna</i> of Ireland,&rdquo;&mdash;truly a
      &ldquo;large order.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I feel that I cannot do better than bring to a close with this story my
      desultory jottings, which may bear to be regarded as a far from complete
      collection of the <i>flora</i> and <i>fauna</i> of journalism. Perhaps my
      researches into these highways and byways may induce some more competent
      and widely experienced brother to publish his notes on men and matters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a jot, not a jot,&rdquo; protested the <i>Moor</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Am I setting the omen at defiance in publishing these Jottings? Perhaps I
      am; though I feel easier in my mind on this point when I recall how, on my
      quoting in an article the proverb, &ldquo;<i>Autres temps, mitres mours&rdquo;</i> a
      wag of a printer caused it to appear, &ldquo;<i>Autres temps, autres</i>
      Moores!&rdquo;

  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty

  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &lsquo;AS-IS&rsquo;, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation&rsquo;s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state&rsquo;s laws.

The Foundation&rsquo;s principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
